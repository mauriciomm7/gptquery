# GPTQuery Documentation

Welcome to GPTQuery — a modular framework for AI-powered tool orchestration.

## Structure

- **Quickstart** → [docs/quickstart.md](./quickstart.md)
- **Developer Guide** → [docs/devsquickstart.md](devsquickstart.md)
- **Architecture** → [docs/architecture.md](./architecture.md)
- **Tools** → [docs/tools/](./tools/)

???+ tip "Tip for Devs"

     I recommend you install the package from the source instead of from `PyPI` using pip since the most up to date, and developing tools requires you to have access to the source code anyways to add your own tool.
