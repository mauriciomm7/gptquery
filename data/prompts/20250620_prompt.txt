# gptquery\tools\extract_citations\prompt.py
"""
gptquery.tools.extract_citations.extract

Extraction prompt templates for identifying missing citations 
in legal questions, focusing on direct citation matching within 
EU law documents only.

Each prompt template defines a clear contract specifying its 
expected input parameters (DataFrame columns) and the expected 
GPT output format. The prompts are designed to produce precise, 
structured outputs listing missing EU legal citations mentioned 
directly in the text, adhering strictly to EU law sources.

Functions:
- prompt_extract_missing: Detailed extraction prompt with 
  configurable granularity (full, article, paragraph).
- prompt_extract_basic: Simplified prompt using default granularity.

These prompts serve as standardized tools for consistent and 
accurate citation extraction in the broader gptquery pipeline.

You are a legal citation extraction expert specializing in EUROPEAN UNION LAW ONLY. Your task is to identify ALL missing EU legal citations that are DIRECTLY mentioned in the question but not covered by the existing citations.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. EXTRACT ONLY EU LEGAL INSTRUMENTS - ignore all national or non-EU sources
2. EXTRACT ONLY DIRECT REFERENCES - do not infer or interpret contextually related citations
3. EXTRACT ALL MISSING CITATIONS - return all directly mentioned but missing citations
4. If ALL directly mentioned citations are already covered, return "NONE"

EU LEGAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE:
- EU Treaties (TEU, TFEU)
- EU Regulations
- EU Directives  
- EU Decisions
- EU Court of Justice (CJEU) cases
- EU General Court cases
- EU Commission decisions
- EU Council decisions

DOCUMENT PARTS:
- main (default for articles, most common)
- preamble (for recitals)
- annex (for annexes)
- appendix (for appendices)
- protocol (for protocols)
- convention (for conventions)
- agreement (for agreements)
- amendment (for amendments)

QUESTION TO ANALYZE:
{question_text}

{existing_citations}

EXTRACTION TASK:
Identify ALL EU legal instruments, articles, paragraphs, or other EU legal provisions that are DIRECTLY mentioned in the question but NOT adequately covered by the existing citations.

DIRECT REFERENCE EXAMPLES:
- Question mentions "Article 108(3) TFEU" → Extract if not covered
- Question mentions "Regulation 1408/71" → Extract if not covered  
- Question mentions "Case C-119/05" → Extract if not covered
- Question mentions "Directive 77/388/EEC" → Extract if not covered

DO NOT EXTRACT:
- Contextually related provisions not directly mentioned
- Background legal frameworks
- Implied or inferred citations
- National laws or non-EU sources

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return ALL missing EU citations in this exact format, separated by newlines:
"CELEX_NUMBER,document_part,structural_element"

Examples:
32014R0050,main,body article 47 paragraph 1 subparagraph 2
12006E108,main,body article 108 paragraph 3
32015R1589main,preamblerecital 15
62019CJ0123,main,body paragraph 25

EXTRACTION RULES:
1. Extract ALL EU legal provisions directly mentioned but missing
2. Use natural language for structural elements (not codes)
3. If no missing EU citations are found, return "NONE"
4. Separate multiple citations with newlines
5. Be conservative - only extract citations you are confident about
6. Consider the granularity level: {granularity}
7. Normalize ordinal references: Convert "first paragraph" to "paragraph 1", "second indent" to "indent 2"
8. Default to "main" when document part is unclear
9. Include highest granularity mentioned: if question mentions both "Article 4" and "Article 4 paragraph 6", include both

GRANULARITY GUIDANCE:
{granularity_instruction}

EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
Input: "Does Article 49 TFEU conflict with Article 56 TFEU, and how does Case C-280/00 Altmark apply?"
Existing: 12006E018,main,body article 18

Output:
12006E049,main,body article 49
12006E056,main,body article 56
62000CJ0280,main,body paragraph 1

EU FOCUS REMINDER: This is strictly for EU law analysis. Do not extract:
- German BGB, French Code Civil, etc.
- US Supreme Court cases
- International conventions (unless EU-specific implementation)
- National constitutional provisions
- Academic commentary

Focus on accuracy over completeness. It's better to return "NONE" than to extract a non-EU source or inferred citation.

CONTEXT CITATION EXAMPLES (for CELEX format reference):
31987R2658,annex I,body note 5 point (b)

QUESTIONS TO ANALYZE:
1.| Is additional note 5(b) to Chapter 20 of the Combined Nomenclature (1) to be interpreted as meaning that the term ‘fruit juices with added sugar’ also refers to fruit juices to which no sugar has actually been added, but whose added sugar content is calculated mathematically in accordance with additional note 5(a) to Chapter 20 of the Combined Nomenclature?
2.| Is additional note 5(b) to Chapter 20 of the Combined Nomenclature to be interpreted as meaning that the term ‘fruit juices in their natural state’ is merely clarified by the words ‘obtained from fruits or by dilution of concentrated juice’, but in fact applies to all types of fruit juices (not cooked and without added alcohol) in the state in which they are presented?
3.| If both the preceding questions are answered in the affirmative, is additional note 5(b) to Chapter 20 of the Combined Nomenclature valid?

GRANULARITY GUIDANCE:
Extract ALL EU legal instruments that are directly mentioned in the questions. Focus on the legal instrument presence only.

TASK: Extract ALL EU legal citations directly mentioned in each question above and return as JSON.
