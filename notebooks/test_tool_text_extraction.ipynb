In\nEurope the cycle seems to be of some thirty years duration. The\nGerman legislature is at present considering a bill which revises\nexhaustively the law of 1937 governing public companies, and when\nthis has been enacted, there will probably follow a bill to modernise\nthe law of 1892 relating to private companies. In France and Belgium\nimportant reforms to the legislation of the 1930's are presently under\nconsideration. In Italy the only proposal currently before the legis-\nlature is one to raise the minimum capital of private companies from\n50,000 to one and a half million lire, but since the present Italian\nlegislation was enacted as recently as 1942, perhaps the cycle for a\ngeneral or extensive revision of the law is as yet incomplete.\n\nProposals for company law reform in Great Britain have not yet\nbeen embodied in a bill presented to Parliament.

V A N  EMDE BOAS\nLecturer in Law at Leyden University\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nI. The current decade has been designated by the General Assembly\nof the United Nations as \"the United Nations' Development Decade.\"\nDuring this period \"member States and their peoples will intensify\ntheir efforts to mobilize and sustain support for the measures required\non the part of both developed and developing countries to accelerate\nprogress towards self-sustaining growth of the economy of the individ-\nual nations and their social advancement so as to attain in each\nunderdeveloped country a substantial increase in the rate of growth,\neach country setting its own target, taking as the objective a minimum\nannual rate of growth of aggregate national income of 5 per cent at\nthe end of the Decade.\"l To meet this aim a considerable increase\nin the flow of capital to the developing countries is necessary.\n\nIt is certain that not enough public capital is available in the form\nof grants or loans, either through multilateral or bilateral channels,\nto provide for the capital needs of the developing countries.= It\nwould moreover seem insufficient to provide merely grants and loans.\n\nKnowledge and technical assistance are necessary to transform the\navailable capital into a sound contribution to economic development.\n\nPsychoIogically and politically there are grave dangers involved in\na sovereign State being dependent on capital grants. Loans have\nto be repaid some day.

These rules have been implemented by some regulations\n(based upon Article 87), the most important of which is Regulation\nNo. 17 of February 6, 1962.l\nThe enforcement of the anti-trust policy in its broadest sense in the\nEuropean Economic Community is mainly entrusted to the Com-\nmission, the executive, which investigates and rules upon infringe-\nments of the prohibitions against agreements etc. under ArticIe 85\nand the abuse of a dominant position under Article 86. Though the\nauthorities of the member States remain also competent to apply\nArticles 85 ( I )  and 86 of the Treaty, this provision is not regarded\nas having much significance in practice. First of all, the powers of the\nnational authorities cease as soon as the Commission has initiated\nany action. Furthermore the Commission has exclusive jurisdiction\nin the application of exemptions under Article 85 (3). AS enterprises\ncoming within the province of Article 85 are likely to invoke paragraph\n(3), even if only by way of alternative, it will usually be impossible\nto apply Article 85 ( I )  without consideration of Article 85 (3), thus\nmaking the intervention of the Commission ine~itable.~\nIn the exercise of its duties in the field of European Anti-trust Law,\nthe Commission has extensive powers. Not only does it have the power\nto undertake investigations of various kinds, but it is entitled to im-\npose substantial fines and penalities for infringements of Articles 85\nand 86 and for offences in connection with enquiries and investiga-\ntions. In practice this means that the Commission has to carry out\nthe duties of investigator, prosecutor and judge. It is true that deci-\nsions imposing fines are stated by the provisions of Article 15 (4) of\nRegulation No. 17 to have no penal character, but this is likeIy to\nhe of little consolation to those on whom they are imposed.\n\nIt must be added that there is an appeal to the Court of Justice,\nunder Article 173 of the Treaty, against all decisions of the Commis-\nsion; and such right of reference to the Court is enjoyed not only by\nthe member States and the Council, but also interested private per-\n* The author is an official of the E.E.C.

The Court may however only re-\nview the legality of the Commission's decisions and not pass judgment\non their merits.

         "TEXT TO ANALYZE:\nT H E  P R O C E D U R E  O F  T H E  E.E.C.-COMMISSION I N\nA N T I T R U S T  CASES\n\nThe Treaty establishing the European Economic Community em-\nbodies in its Articles 85-90 a concise anti-cartel and anti-trust legis-\nlation. These rules have been implemented by some regulations\n(based upon Article 87), the most important of which is Regulation\nNo. 17 of February 6, 1962.l\nThe enforcement of the anti-trust policy in its broadest sense in the\nEuropean Economic Community is mainly entrusted to the Com-\nmission, the executive, which investigates and rules upon infringe-\nments of the prohibitions against agreements etc. under ArticIe 85\nand the abuse of a dominant position under Article 86. Though the\nauthorities of the member States remain also competent to apply\nArticles 85 ( I )  and 86 of the Treaty, this provision is not regarded\nas having much significance in practice. First of all, the powers of the\nnational authorities cease as soon as the Commission has initiated\nany action. Furthermore the Commission has exclusive jurisdiction\nin the application of exemptions under Article 85 (3). AS enterprises\ncoming within the province of Article 85 are likely to invoke paragraph\n(3), even if only by way of alternative, it will usually be impossible\nto apply Article 85 ( I )  without consideration of Article 85 (3), thus\nmaking the intervention of the Commission ine~itable.~\nIn the exercise of its duties in the field of European Anti-trust Law,\nthe Commission has extensive powers. Not only does it have the power\nto undertake investigations of various kinds, but it is entitled to im-\npose substantial fines and penalities for infringements of Articles 85\nand 86 and for offences in connection with enquiries and investiga-\ntions. In practice this means that the Commission has to carry out\nthe duties of investigator, prosecutor and judge. It is true that deci-\nsions imposing fines are stated by the provisions of Article 15 (4) of\nRegulation No. 17 to have no penal character, but this is likeIy to\nhe of little consolation to those on whom they are imposed.\n\nIt must be added that there is an appeal to the Court of Justice,\nunder Article 173 of the Treaty, against all decisions of the Commis-\nsion; and such right of reference to the Court is enjoyed not only by\nthe member States and the Council, but also interested private per-\n* The author is an official of the E.E.C.

The Court may however only re-\nview the legality of the Commission's decisions and not pass judgment\non their merits.

P O L I T I C A L -  E C O N O M I C  P O I N T S  O F  V I E W  A N D\nP R E L I M I N A R Y  E C O N O M I C  QUESTIONS\nThe inclusion of transport in the European integration is a logical\nnecessity under the treaties. The treaties for the establishment ofthe\nEuropean Economic Community, the European Coal and Steel Com-\nmunity and Euratom create the obligation for this integration, for\nthese embrace all fields of the economic and social life of the member\nStates.l It would not have been compatible with the concept of an\nall-embracing economic union to exclude any particular economic\nsector. The partners could only try to ensure that some parts of the\neconomic activities of the member States might be integrated to a\ncertain level in a special way. It remains to be seen what meaning\nthis has for transport, for which, together with agriculture, it was\nspecially designed.\n\nDuring the discussion about the \"how\" of European integration\nthere appeared from the start two important questions: Do the insti-\ntutions of the Community have to create a \"Common Transport\nMarket5'-or\nis it enough to have a \"Common Transport Policy\"?\n\nThis is not the mere battle of words it may seem. There are under-\nlying economic political contradictions. But, of course, it is doubtful\nwhether these opposites are sufficiently defined by these two expres-\nsions.

The treaties for the establishment ofthe\nEuropean Economic Community, the European Coal and Steel Com-\nmunity and Euratom create the obligation for this integration, for\nthese embrace all fields of the economic and social life of the member\nStates.l It would not have been compatible with the concept of an\nall-embracing economic union to exclude any particular economic\nsector. The partners could only try to ensure that some parts of the\neconomic activities of the member States might be integrated to a\ncertain level in a special way. It remains to be seen what meaning\nthis has for transport, for which, together with agriculture, it was\nspecially designed.\n\nDuring the discussion about the \"how\" of European integration\nthere appeared from the start two important questions: Do the insti-\ntutions of the Community have to create a \"Common Transport\nMarket5'-or\nis it enough to have a \"Common Transport Policy\"?\n\nThis is not the mere battle of words it may seem. There are under-\nlying economic political contradictions. But, of course, it is doubtful\nwhether these opposites are sufficiently defined by these two expres-\nsions. The main point is to examine whether this antithesis of \"Com-\nmon Transport Market\" and \"Common Transport Policy\" is justified\nby the Treaty of Rome. Political and economic questions should\nnot be confused with problems of legal interpretation.

ROBERT\nKRUITHOF\nAssistant at the Law Faculu, UniuersiQ of Ghent\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\nThe Common Market regulation of competition between private\nfirms is an expression of continental European economic and political\nphilosophies and interests. Due to the differences with other philoso-\nphies and interests, transactions affecting trade in the Common Market\nand in one or more foreign markets may, therefore, be subject to\nconflicting regulatory policies. The application of the E.E.C. anti-trust\nprovisions creates such conflicts, for the economic policies sf foreign\ncountries allow or even encourage restraints of competition prohibited\nby the Common Market anti-trust laws, and vice versa.\n\nMost countries, for example, permit export cartels. However, what\nconstitutes exports for one country means imports for another. Since\nmost countries apply their anti-trust laws to imports, it is obvious that\nthis situation leads to conflicts of law.

ROBERT\nKRUITHOF\nAssistant at the Law Faculu, UniuersiQ of Ghent\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\nThe Common Market regulation of competition between private\nfirms is an expression of continental European economic and political\nphilosophies and interests. Due to the differences with other philoso-\nphies and interests, transactions affecting trade in the Common Market\nand in one or more foreign markets may, therefore, be subject to\nconflicting regulatory policies. The application of the E.E.C. anti-trust\nprovisions creates such conflicts, for the economic policies sf foreign\ncountries allow or even encourage restraints of competition prohibited\nby the Common Market anti-trust laws, and vice versa.\n\nMost countries, for example, permit export cartels. However, what\nconstitutes exports for one country means imports for another. Since\nmost countries apply their anti-trust laws to imports, it is obvious that\nthis situation leads to conflicts of law. Another example : in the United\nStates certain cartels are illegal per se, i.e., they are conclusively\npresumed to be illegal by reason of their nature or their necessary\neffects. In most European countries, on the other hand, these same\nrestrictive trade practices are usually legal when they contribute to\nthe improvement of production or distribution and when they are\nnot detrimental to the interests of the consumers. Consequently, an\nagreement between an American and a French company to divide\nthe European market and to fix prices in that part of the world would\nprobably be declared illegal by the American courts as an unreaso-\nnable restraint on the American foreign commerce, but might be\njustifiable under Article 85, para. 3 of the Rome Treaty.\n\nBefore the problem of the applicability of the Common Market\nanti-trust provisions to inter~lational restraints of trade can be dis-\ncussed, it is necessary to define the term international restraint of\ntrade.

BERNHARD\nGROSSFELD\nUniversitat Miiwterl Wesualen\nThe draft proposal for a Directive for the co-ordination of the guaran-\ntees in company laws protecting the interests of members and of\nthird parties makes a contribution to the approximation of laws in\nanimportant fieldinside the European Economic Community (E.E.C.).\n\nThe liberalisation of the economy which to a large extent has been\nachieved in the E.E.C. brings along with it in ever increasing\nmeasure the need that the rules of national company laws extend\nbeyond the boundaries of a single nation-state. This trend is particularly\nstrong with regard to corporations and other companies having\nshare capital. Therefore, an assimilation of laws in this sector is\nurgently needed.\n\nT H E  P R E S E N T  D I F F I C U L T I E S\nThe basic legal provision is Article 58 ( I )  of the E.E.C. Treaty.\n\nIt provides that companies which have been constituted in accordance\nwith the law of a member State and having their registered office,\ncentral management or main establishment within the Community\nshall be assimilated to natural persons being nationals of member\nStates. Therefore, the freedom of establishment laid down in the\nE,E.C. Treaty is also applicable to them. From this it follows that the\nduty to grant the right of establishment carries with it the obligation\nto recognise the companies defined in Article 58 (2) both as a legal\nentity and as being able to act under the law of the land. As it stands\nalready today, the general recognition of business companies inside\nthe Community presents no major difficultie~.~\nThis liberal structure\nI .

This trend is particularly\nstrong with regard to corporations and other companies having\nshare capital. Therefore, an assimilation of laws in this sector is\nurgently needed.\n\nT H E  P R E S E N T  D I F F I C U L T I E S\nThe basic legal provision is Article 58 ( I )  of the E.E.C. Treaty.\n\nIt provides that companies which have been constituted in accordance\nwith the law of a member State and having their registered office,\ncentral management or main establishment within the Community\nshall be assimilated to natural persons being nationals of member\nStates. Therefore, the freedom of establishment laid down in the\nE,E.C. Treaty is also applicable to them. From this it follows that the\nduty to grant the right of establishment carries with it the obligation\nto recognise the companies defined in Article 58 (2) both as a legal\nentity and as being able to act under the law of the land. As it stands\nalready today, the general recognition of business companies inside\nthe Community presents no major difficultie~.~\nThis liberal structure\nI .

They are constituted not by the aggregate\nof the measures actually applied at that date, but by such measures as can be ap-\nplied immediately and actually as part of the organisation. An increase in internal\ncost factors resulting in an increase in the national price guarantees above the level\nof January I, 1958, must also lead to an increase of the variable import duty. If\nthis is impossible, or cannot be carried out without co-operation of the Community,\none cannot speak of maintenance of the existing national system. If, on the other\nhand, the judgment envisages solely the introduction of new charges, Article 12 is\ngiven a reasonable application with regard to agricultural products, mentioned in\nthe list of Annex 11 to the Treaty. The impossibility to charge imports as a comple-\nment of internal measures either disqualifies the system existing on January I, 1958\nas a national market organisation, or it does not. In the former case a national\nmarket organisation does not exist and the Treaty nowhere offers the States a basis for\nestablishing a national market organisation for agricultural products listed in An-\nnex I1 following the entry into force of the Treaty. In the latter case the national\nmarket organisation was complete on January I, 1958. But its extension to new\ncomponents has no basis in the Treaty either. Within the limits thus drawn, the\njudgment would also make the greatest contribution to the actual substitution of\nnational market organisations by Community organisation where necessary. The\nview defended by Belgium and Luxembourg, with its exceptional liberty for the\nnational authorities to extend and intensify existing systems, would hardly encour-\nSk.\n\nage such substitution.\n\nB.

Its components\nmust have existed on January I, 1958. They are constituted not by the aggregate\nof the measures actually applied at that date, but by such measures as can be ap-\nplied immediately and actually as part of the organisation. An increase in internal\ncost factors resulting in an increase in the national price guarantees above the level\nof January I, 1958, must also lead to an increase of the variable import duty. If\nthis is impossible, or cannot be carried out without co-operation of the Community,\none cannot speak of maintenance of the existing national system. If, on the other\nhand, the judgment envisages solely the introduction of new charges, Article 12 is\ngiven a reasonable application with regard to agricultural products, mentioned in\nthe list of Annex 11 to the Treaty. The impossibility to charge imports as a comple-\nment of internal measures either disqualifies the system existing on January I, 1958\nas a national market organisation, or it does not. In the former case a national\nmarket organisation does not exist and the Treaty nowhere offers the States a basis for\nestablishing a national market organisation for agricultural products listed in An-\nnex I1 following the entry into force of the Treaty. In the latter case the national\nmarket organisation was complete on January I, 1958. But its extension to new\ncomponents has no basis in the Treaty either. Within the limits thus drawn, the\njudgment would also make the greatest contribution to the actual substitution of\nnational market organisations by Community organisation where necessary. The\nview defended by Belgium and Luxembourg, with its exceptional liberty for the\nnational authorities to extend and intensify existing systems, would hardly encour-\nSk.\n\nage such substitution.\n\nB.

         "POLHTPCAL U N I O N  I N  E U R O P E\n\nJ O H N  PINDER, London\nThe meaning of the term \"olitical union\"\nThe term political union is a confusing one. The word union is\nstretched in this context to denote a variety of forms of association,\nranging from a loose alliance where heads of state or of government\nmeet each other three times a year, to a highly-organised political\ncommunity or a federation. But if \"union\" is ambiguous, \"poolitical'\"\nis misleading; for it is used here in contradistinction to   economic'^, to\nindicate a union that is concerned with questions of foreign policy\nand defence, as if economic questions were in some sense outside\npolitics.\n\nYet, if a question can be classed as \"political\" to the extent that it\noccupies the time of parliament or of government, or becomes an issue\nthat wins or loses votes during an election, then economic questions are\npar excellence the political ones of this century. What could be more\npolitical than the power to control agricultural prices and subsidies?\n\nTo keep open coal mines or to shut them down? To prosecute mono-\npolies and cartels or to leave them be? To decide on social policies such\nas equal pay for women? These are matters within the competence of\nthe European Economic Community and the European Coal and\nSteel Community. It seems strange to attach the word \"political\" to\ndefence arrangements but not to issues such as these.\n\nIt seems equally strange to speak of a political union that will deal\nwith foreign policy while the Economic Community deals with\neconomic policy.

         "TEXT TO ANALYZE:\nPOLHTPCAL U N I O N  I N  E U R O P E\n\nJ O H N  PINDER, London\nThe meaning of the term \"olitical union\"\nThe term political union is a confusing one. The word union is\nstretched in this context to denote a variety of forms of association,\nranging from a loose alliance where heads of state or of government\nmeet each other three times a year, to a highly-organised political\ncommunity or a federation. But if \"union\" is ambiguous, \"poolitical'\"\nis misleading; for it is used here in contradistinction to   economic'^, to\nindicate a union that is concerned with questions of foreign policy\nand defence, as if economic questions were in some sense outside\npolitics.\n\nYet, if a question can be classed as \"political\" to the extent that it\noccupies the time of parliament or of government, or becomes an issue\nthat wins or loses votes during an election, then economic questions are\npar excellence the political ones of this century. What could be more\npolitical than the power to control agricultural prices and subsidies?\n\nTo keep open coal mines or to shut them down? To prosecute mono-\npolies and cartels or to leave them be? To decide on social policies such\nas equal pay for women? These are matters within the competence of\nthe European Economic Community and the European Coal and\nSteel Community. It seems strange to attach the word \"political\" to\ndefence arrangements but not to issues such as these.\n\nIt seems equally strange to speak of a political union that will deal\nwith foreign policy while the Economic Community deals with\neconomic policy. The institutions of the Economic Community are\nalready responsible for the major part of the external economic\nrelations of the Community, and in particular for negotiations relating\nto tariffs and other barriers to trade. And just as economics is the\nsubject matter of a large proportion of contemporary politics, so are\nexternal economic relations a substantial part of the subject matter of\nforeign policy. Indeed, it would be more reasonable, since economics\nand defence are the two great pillars of foreign policy, to speak of an\neconomic union (or community) and a defence union (or community)\nas the two bases of political, or foreign policy, union.\n\nThus it is more enlightening to consider the Economic Community\nas one half of a political union, which may eventually be completed by\nthe addition of a defence union.

Joined Cases 1 and 14/57, SociWdes usines a tubes de la Sarre, [I9571 E.C.R. 105,\n112-3.\n\nCML Rev. 1987\n552\nCaselaw\nin particular.17 Should a Member State be charged with the breach of a\nregulation, it will certainly seek to plead an exception of illegality ac-\ncording to which it may invoke all of the grounds specified in Article 173\nEEC.\n\nThere appears some discrepancy between Article 184 and the jurispru-\ndence of the Court. Of course the situation is not quite comparable. One\ninstance concerns regulations, the other decisions. Moreover, in the one\ninstance a Treaty provision is the legal basis for an objection; in the other\ndeveloping case law. In the case of a breach of a regulation a Member\nState may invoke in support of its plea of illegality any ground as speci-\nfied in Article 173 EEC; in a proceeding for a breach of a decision it may,\nfollowing the present jurisprudence, only plead a lack of competence of\na Community institution or an absolute impossibility to implement the\ndecision. The Court faces in this instance a difficult dilemma. The Court\nmay hardly admit as an admissible defence, by analogy with Article 184\nEEC, any objection based on any ground of illegality as provided for by\nArticle 173 of the Treaty, against the Commission's charge of a breached\ndecision. If the Court did so, it would in fact be admitting a plea of il-\nlegality against such a decision which it has clearly rejected.18 As far as\na Commission action for breach of a directive is concerned, a limited\nreview of objections following the jurisprudence of the Court may also\nbe envisaged.\n\nA final observation on this line of case law in which the Court appears\nto be influenced by the very nature of the infringement procedure by\nwhich the Member States have attempted to raise various objections. For\nobvious reasons the Court has been rather strict in admitting them. Its\ncase law is rather meagre to permit a reliable distinction between ad-\nmissible and inadmissible objections. Where does the Court intend to\ndraw the line between objections which it admits in such a procedure and\nthose in which it declines to examine the objections because the act\nallegedly breached has become definite?

         "TEXT TO ANALYZE:\nl. The more so as the\nCourt seems to recognize, at least implicity, the right of Member States\nto make such a plea in general and in a general infringement procedure\n16. Joined Cases 1 and 14/57, SociWdes usines a tubes de la Sarre, [I9571 E.C.R. 105,\n112-3.\n\nCML Rev. 1987\n552\nCaselaw\nin particular.17 Should a Member State be charged with the breach of a\nregulation, it will certainly seek to plead an exception of illegality ac-\ncording to which it may invoke all of the grounds specified in Article 173\nEEC.\n\nThere appears some discrepancy between Article 184 and the jurispru-\ndence of the Court. Of course the situation is not quite comparable. One\ninstance concerns regulations, the other decisions. Moreover, in the one\ninstance a Treaty provision is the legal basis for an objection; in the other\ndeveloping case law. In the case of a breach of a regulation a Member\nState may invoke in support of its plea of illegality any ground as speci-\nfied in Article 173 EEC; in a proceeding for a breach of a decision it may,\nfollowing the present jurisprudence, only plead a lack of competence of\na Community institution or an absolute impossibility to implement the\ndecision. The Court faces in this instance a difficult dilemma. The Court\nmay hardly admit as an admissible defence, by analogy with Article 184\nEEC, any objection based on any ground of illegality as provided for by\nArticle 173 of the Treaty, against the Commission's charge of a breached\ndecision. If the Court did so, it would in fact be admitting a plea of il-\nlegality against such a decision which it has clearly rejected.18 As far as\na Commission action for breach of a directive is concerned, a limited\nreview of objections following the jurisprudence of the Court may also\nbe envisaged.\n\nA final observation on this line of case law in which the Court appears\nto be influenced by the very nature of the infringement procedure by\nwhich the Member States have attempted to raise various objections. For\nobvious reasons the Court has been rather strict in admitting them. Its\ncase law is rather meagre to permit a reliable distinction between ad-\nmissible and inadmissible objections. Where does the Court intend to\ndraw the line between objections which it admits in such a procedure and\nthose in which it declines to examine the objections because the act\nallegedly breached has become definite? The reasoning of the Court jus-\ntifying an examination of a plea of lacking of competence of a Com-\n17. Cases 32/65, Italy v. Commission, [I9661 E.C.R. 389, 409-410; 156/77, Commis-\nsion v.

It examines the broad spectrum of ways in which the Court deals\nwith secondary law, considering in particular the extent to which the\nCourt allows the passage of secondary legislation to affect its reading of\nprimary law. The case law of the Court is difficult to predict, and difficult\nto evaluate.

         "LUXEMBOURG REVISITED\nor\nTHE IMPORTANCE O F  EUROPEAN POLITICAL COOPERATION\n\nOtto von der Gablentz*\n\n1. Introduction\nEight years ago, the foreign ministers of the countries of the European\nCommunity approved the Luxembourg Report,' the birth certificate of\nEuropean Political Cooperation (\"EPC\"). It was a brain-child of the\nrenewed interest in political cooperation aroused by the prospect of the first\nenlargement of the Community. Consequently, systematic diplomatic co-\noperation among Member Srates, set in motion by the Luxembourg Report\nof 27 October 1970, was conceived as a first step on the road to more\ncomprehensive political cooperation. It called upon Member States to\n\"provide in an initial phase the mechanism for harmonising their views\nregarding international affairs\".\n\nThere was, however, no subsequent phase fitting this network of diplo-\nmatic cooperation into a wider European political framework.

Introduction\nEight years ago, the foreign ministers of the countries of the European\nCommunity approved the Luxembourg Report,' the birth certificate of\nEuropean Political Cooperation (\"EPC\"). It was a brain-child of the\nrenewed interest in political cooperation aroused by the prospect of the first\nenlargement of the Community. Consequently, systematic diplomatic co-\noperation among Member Srates, set in motion by the Luxembourg Report\nof 27 October 1970, was conceived as a first step on the road to more\ncomprehensive political cooperation. It called upon Member States to\n\"provide in an initial phase the mechanism for harmonising their views\nregarding international affairs\".\n\nThere was, however, no subsequent phase fitting this network of diplo-\nmatic cooperation into a wider European political framework. The concept\nof European Union was in practice relegated to the realm of long-term\npolitical goals. The Tindemans Report2 defined it in terms of an ongoing\nprocess and not as a series of clearly defined constitutional innovations.\n\nSome progress was achieved by ad hoc decisions such as\n\n-\nthe Copenhagen Report of 23 July 19733 containing practical improve-\nments to EPC and an undertaking by the Member States to consult their\npartners as a general rule on all important questions of foreign policy\nconcerning European interests before taking final decisions.\n\n-\nthe Paris Summit of 9/10 December 19744 creating the European Coun-\ncil as a supreme political authority covering both the Community and EPC\n* Assistant Undersecretary, Bundeskanzleramt.

         "he merits of the case. And it did so in a quite interesting\nmanner: though sanctioned in the framework of measures directed against a third country,\nnamely Côte d’Ivoire, the GC found that EU institutions are under an obligation to\ncommunicate “les raisons spécifiques et concrètes pour lesquelles le Conseil considère, dans\nl’exercice de son pouvoir discrétionnaire d’appréciation, que l’intéressé doit faire l’objet de\ntelles mesures” (Bamba, para 47 English text not yet available). This amounts to saying that the\nCouncil should have proved the applicant’s involvement in the contested State policy which led\nto the sanctions, namely the obstructions “aux processus de paix et de réconciliation par\nl’incitation publique à la haine et à la violence et par la participation à des campagnes de\ndésinformation” (ibid., para 52) related to the presidential election of 2010.As the Council had\nfailed to do so, the applicant’s right to bring an action in accordance with EU procedural\nstandards was infringed, and the contested regulation was subsequently declared invalid insofar\nas it concerned Mrs Bamba (ibid., para 56 et seq.).\n65. Section 4 supra.\n\nCase C-376/10 P\n1785\n\nelements in support of this (optimistic) view. First, the General Court itself\nseems to have changed its mind. Second, the indications of Advocate General\nMengozzi in Tay Za are unambiguous. Third, and most important, it will be\nhard to ignore Lisbon’s novelties: as already seen, both Article 75 and 215\nTFEU contain an identical fundamental rights clause, clearly speaking in\nfavour of an equation of these two situations as far as due process guarantees\nare concerned.\n\nThe present case represented an important opportunity to have a ruling of\nthe Court of Justice on this controversial but crucial point. If one considers the\njudgment from this perspective, the famous line of an ancient Latin fable\nseems apposite: Parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus (“Mountains will\nlabour: what’s born? A ridiculous mouse!”).66 True, it is very likely that the\nCourt will have to come back at a later time to the problem of fundamental\nrights raised by cases like the present one, as EU institutions will have no\nproblems of legal basis in the future, at least in terms of existence of such\nbasis. The ECJ’s requirements as formulated in Tay Za can be considered\nfulfilled by post-Lisbon amendments and practice.Then it is predicable that in\nforthcoming, similar cases there will finally be room for the Court to address\nand resolve the question of due process standards enjoyed by an individual\ntargeted under a bilateral sanctions regime.\n\nLuca Pantaleo*\nPost scriptum\nA few days after the submission of this case note, the Grand Chamber of the\nECJ handed down its judgment in Case C-130/10, Parliament v. Council of the\nEuropean Union. In its ruling, the Court essentially followed A.G. Bot’s\nfindings, stating that Article 215(2) TFEU does indeed constitute the correct\n(and sole) legal basis for a regulation implementing UN sanctions against\nsuspected terrorists. In light of this ruling, it seems safe to assume that the\nsame provision suffices alone also in situations such as those examined in this\ncase note. Once the gap concerning the legal basis is filled, one can finally\nexpect a decision of the ECJ that touches upon human rights issues at stake in\nthe context of bilateral sanctions regimes affecting private natural or legal\npersons.\n\n66.

NEUWAHL *\n\n1. Introduction\nTogether with its Member States, the European Community is one of the\nmost powerful actors on the world's international economic scene, with\na corresponding potential for political leverage. European integration\nbeing more of a process than an accomplished situation, however,\nwe are confronted with a complex, evolving entity of a non-unitary\ncharacter, and the Community frequently acts jointly with its Member\nStates when it comes to concluding an international agreement with\nThird States. Mixed agreements are puzzling on a number of accounts,\nhiding as they do the division of treaty-making and implementing\npowers among the Community and the Member States. Questions as\nto what is the best procedure for the conclusion of such treaties, what\nis their effect in Community law and how do they affect private parties\nmay be unclear to the average observer. Nevertheless, the attitude of\nthe European Court of Justice (ECJ) has always been pragmatic.\n\nNever has the Court opined that mixity is objectionable, or that a\nclarification of the respective powers is necessary in the relations with\nThird States contracting parties, nor even between the Community\nand its Member States. This ''bene~olent'~\nattitude towards mixity is\n* Professor of European Law, The University of Liverpool. Very special thanks\nto David O'Keeffe (University College London) and Henry G. Schemers (Rijksuni-\nversiteit te Leiden), without whom there would definitely have been less on mixity.\n\nThanks also to Allan Rosas, European Commission, Legal Service, without whom\nthis would be there, but later.\n\nCML Rev. 1996\n668 Neuwahl\nillustrated in the Court's recent case law on the matter, not least the\nWTO Opinion.' There, the European Commission, acting under Arti-\ncle 228(6) EC, sought to extract from the Court a statement that the\nCommunity should proceed to the conclusion of the Uruguay Round\nAgreements without its Member States. The request by the Commis-\nsion was based on the consideration that at least the overwhelming\nmajority of the WTO commitments came within the exclusive powers\nof the Community, and that having the Member States participate in\nthe agreements alongside the Community, even in the assumption that\nin some fields they held concurrent powers, could lead to awkward\nproblems of cross-retaliation in the framework of the WTO dispute\nsettlement mechanism.\n\nThe Court, unmoved by the Commission's reasoning, made it clear\nthat the Community did not have the exclusive power for all the cornmit-\nments, but rather, that powers were \"shared\". This also implied a duty\nof cooperation between the Community and the Member States, which\nthe Court offered as the panacea for situations where the Communi-\nty risked being debilitated by the presence of the individual Member\nStates, or the Member States by the existence of the\nThe concept of \"shared power\", as well as that of \"joint competence\",\nwhich the Court seems to use interchangeably, appears more and more\nfrequently in the case law of the Court of Justice, notably in its answers\nto requests for Opinions under Article 228(6) EC. Thus, the Court\nhas held that the competence to conclude the General Agreement on\nTrade in Services (GATS) is \"shared between the Community and\nthe Member  state^,^ and that the Community and the Member States\nare \"jointly competent\" to conclude the Agreement on Trade-Related\nAspects of Intellectual Property",

Joined Cases 1 and 14/57, SociWdes usines a tubes de la Sarre, [I9571 E.C.R. 105,\n112-3.\n\nCML Rev. 1987\n552\nCaselaw\nin particular.17 Should a Member State be charged with the breach of a\nregulation, it will certainly seek to plead an exception of illegality ac-\ncording to which it may invoke all of the grounds specified in Article 173\nEEC.\n\nThere appears some discrepancy between Article 184 and the jurispru-\ndence of the Court. Of course the situation is not quite comparable. One\ninstance concerns regulations, the other decisions. Moreover, in the one\ninstance a Treaty provision is the legal basis for an objection; in the other\ndeveloping case law. In the case of a breach of a regulation a Member\nState may invoke in support of its plea of illegality any ground as speci-\nfied in Article 173 EEC; in a proceeding for a breach of a decision it may,\nfollowing the present jurisprudence, only plead a lack of competence of\na Community institution or an absolute impossibility to implement the\ndecision. The Court faces in this instance a difficult dilemma. The Court\nmay hardly admit as an admissible defence, by analogy with Article 184\nEEC, any objection based on any ground of illegality as provided for by\nArticle 173 of the Treaty, against the Commission's charge of a breached\ndecision. If the Court did so, it would in fact be admitting a plea of il-\nlegality against such a decision which it has clearly rejected.18 As far as\na Commission action for breach of a directive is concerned, a limited\nreview of objections following the jurisprudence of the Court may also\nbe envisaged.\n\nA final observation on this line of case law in which the Court appears\nto be influenced by the very nature of the infringement procedure by\nwhich the Member States have attempted to raise various objections. For\nobvious reasons the Court has been rather strict in admitting them. Its\ncase law is rather meagre to permit a reliable distinction between ad-\nmissible and inadmissible objections. Where does the Court intend to\ndraw the line between objections which it admits in such a procedure and\nthose in which it declines to examine the objections because the act\nallegedly breached has become definite? The reasoning of the Court jus-\ntifying an examination of a plea of lacking of competence of a Com-\n17. Cases 32/65, Italy v. Commission, [I9661 E.C.R. 389, 409-410; 156/77, Commis-\nsion v.

Even in this instance it\ncould be argued that the Court could not rule on a breach of a Com-\nmunity act unless it had established that the act in question conformed\nmaterially to Community law and provided, therefore, a legal basis for\nan infringement action.\nA certain flexibility, it is suggested, may be necessary in such a pro-\ncedure but not to the detriment of legal certainty, a requirement the\nCourt has never failed to stress. For this reason, the failure of a Member\nState to contest under Article 173 EEC an act for the breach of which\nit is being charged might be of some, if not decisive, importance in the\nconsideration of the admissibility of objections raised later in an in-\nfringement proceeding.\n\nGerhard Bebr*\n\n* Former Legal Adviser to the European Communities and member of the Advisory\nBoard of the Common Market Law Review.",

In its pre-\nparedness to review the Directive for want of proportionality, the Court\nwas therefore in reality moving from “legality” to “expediency”.15\nHaving given with that hand, however, the Court took away with its\nother: it went on to limit the application of the doctrine of proportion-\nality in the ﬁeld of social policy decisions to cases of manifest error,\nexcess or misuse of powers. This is a disappointing development for\njudicial review in European Community law. It suggests that the wider\nthe discretion enjoyed by the executive the less intrusive will be the\ndoctrine of proportionality; yet it is arguably needed more in such cases\nthan in those where the extent of power conferred on the executive is\nitself narrower and therefore leaves less room for choice.\n\nFinally, two more general points require to be made in the context of\nthis judgment. First, it might perhaps be argued that, notwithstanding\nthe statements made by the Court as to the ambit of Article 118A, the\nAgreement and Protocol on Social Policy annexed to the EC Treaty by\nthe Maastricht Treaty and from which the UK is excluded mean that\nhenceforth Article 118A is ousted where the Agreement applies; this\nargument would seem to be refuted by the Preamble to the Protocol\nwhich states that it and the Agreement are “without prejudice to the\nprovisions of this Treaty, particularly those relating to social policy\nwhich constitute an integral part of the ‘acquis communautaire’ ”.\n\nSecond, the breadth of the language used by the Court in this case,\nin particular as regards the meaning of health and safety, preserves the\nlegality of other measures, including some whose connection with these\naims might otherwise be regarded as somewhat tenuous. In particular,\n15. The importance of this distinction would become even more marked were it to\nbe held that the general principles of European Community law, including propor-\ntionality, applied to purely domestic measures, as well as to those taken pursuant to\nCommunity law; in R v. MAFF, Ex p. First City Trading Ltd [1997] 1 CMLR 250,\nLaws J restricted the application of the general principles of Community law to the\nsecond category of cases.\n\n1060\nCase Law\nCML Rev. 1997\nthe Directive on Pregnancy16 appears to be vindicated, notwithstanding\nits provisions dealing with pay.17 Such a conclusion, though wholly to\nbe welcomed in the view of the present writer, leaves one wondering\nabout what other future measures might be justiﬁed on the same basis.\n\nWould Article 118A, for example, authorize a directive prescribing\na minimum rate of pay or one requiring positive action in favour of\ndisadvantaged groups of workers?\n\nEvelyn Ellis\n\u0003\n\n16.

On the one hand, in the series of UK v. Council\n(social security) cases in 2013–2014, the ECJ took a common approach for the\nEEA and the EU-Switzerland arrangements, which contrasted with that taken\ntowards the Ankara Agreement.85 On the other hand, in Grimme, the ECJ\nemphasized that Switzerland, by its refusal to join the EEA, “did not subscribe\nto the project of an economically integrated entity with a single market, based\non common rules between its members, but chose the route of bilateral\narrangements between the Community and its Member States in specific\nareas”.86 This was followed up, for example, in Hengartner and Gasser and\nPicard, where the ECJ interpreted provisions of the EU-Switzerland\nAgreement on the free movement of persons differently from the EU rules\napplicable to similar situations (freedom to provide services and freedom of\nestablishment), thus refusing to extend to Switzerland the approach taken in\nrelation to the EEA EFTA States.87\nAlthough less “special” than the EU-EEA EFTA States relationship, will\nthe EU-Switzerland arrangements be considered special enough to warrant\nthe extension of I.N. also to Swiss nationals?And if not, would the institutional\nset-up\nenvisaged\nby\nthe\nstill\nunsigned\nEU-Switzerland\nFramework\nAgreement make a difference in this regard?88 Future case law will hopefully\nclarify whether the I.N. approach can indeed be extended to other EU relations\nwith other European States, i.e. non-EEA/non-EFTA, and their nationals, and\nif so under what conditions and within which limits.

Conclusion\nThe Coleman judgment is significant for confirming that the Employment\nEquality Directive prohibits direct discrimination and harassment by associa-\ntion on the grounds of disability. This form of discrimination is potentially\nwidespread, and the Court’s judgment is to be welcomed for the protection it\nconfers on vulnerable individuals. Moreover, the decision should in all proba-\nbility be read to mean that the EC non-discrimination directives prohibit direct\ndiscrimination and harassment by association across all Article 13 EC grounds.\n\nSuch an interpretation can easily be accommodated in most Member States, as,\nin many case, the relevant definitions of discrimination found in the Directive\nhave simply been copied into the national implementation legislation. How-\never, the status of indirect discrimination by association was not addressed in\nthe judgment, and current indications are that this is not prohibited by the EC\nnon-discrimination directives. The judgment is also of interest for the Court’s\n(somewhat confusing) comments on the obligation to provide a reasonable\naccommodation. Thus far the Court has not been called on to interpret Article\n5 of the Directive68 and, when it is finally called upon to do so, it is hoped that\nits approach will provide more conceptual clarity than found in Coleman.\n\nLisa Waddington*\n\n66.

Judgment, paras. 26 and 31.\n\nCML Rev. 2015\nCase law\n544\n\nprincipled language carrying with it very distinct understandings of Union\ncitizenship and of the criminal law. Union citizenship is a status of integration\nthat requires of its holders the adoption of a particular attitude and an\nacceptance of the norms and values of the host society. The continued\nenjoyment of Union citizenship and the gaining of future rights is contingent\non good behaviour and compliance with a set of obligations embodied in the\nhost State’s criminal law.59 Combining an understanding of Union citizenship\nand permanent residence as a status to be earned after a period of integration,\nrespectful of the values of the host society and of the criminal law as a moral\nand normative code reflecting those values, leads to the situation whereby the\nacquisition of permanent residence is dependent on a period of good\nbehaviour. It is in short a form of probationary citizenship.\n\nThis is not a result that flows naturally from the text of the Directive but\narises from reading that Directive in light of a particular ideology and vision of\nUnion citizenship. Beyond a view of Union citizenship as a status of\nintegration,60 virtually none of the interpretative choices made by the Court\nare rooted in the provisions of the Directive. Nowhere does the Directive state\nthat permanent residence is a “reward” for a period of integration, nor does it\nimpose additional requirements of a “qualitative” nature, let alone normative,\nbeyond conditions of economic activity or self-sufficiency.61 Aside from\nArticle 28 on the public order exception, the Directive is silent regarding the\npossible impact of periods of imprisonment or criminal activity on the\nresidence rights of an individual. It does not equate imprisonment to an\nunderlying disregard for the values of the host society, nor does it contain a\nparticularly moral vision of criminal law, viewing it as the expression of the\nvalues of the host society. All of these findings are the result of the Court\nreading the Directive in the light of a particular vision of Union citizenship.\n\nThat is not to say it is an illegitimate interpretation of the Directive. In any act\nof legal interpretation, choices must be made. But we should be clear\nregarding the background principles and political vision informing those\nchoices and their consequences. The choice made in Onuekwere introduces a\nprobationary element into Union citizenship or at least the acquisition of\npermanent residence, it draws further distinctions between Union citizens62\n\n59. To this extent it is possible that we are seeing the emergence of a set of duties, albeit it\nrelatively limited, attaching to Union citizenship thereby adding some substance to the\nreference to duties contained in Art. 20(2) TFEU.\n60. See recitals 17 and 18 Citizenship Directive (cited supra note 5).\n61. That may in any event, in contrast to the Court’s ruling in Case C-325/09, Dias, be\ninterpreted more as ensuring that the individual is not a financial burden on the host Member\nState rather than envisaging an active process of social integration.\n62.

There has not\nas yet been a single judgment relating to the changes which were made\nat the time the new Member States acceded to the Convention.\n\nThe Court has concentrated most of its interventions on six argu-\nments: as far as general problems are concerned, the autonomous\ncharacter of certain concepts flowing from the Convention, and the\ndefinition of the field of application of the Convention; as far as juris-\ndiction is concerned, Article 5, on special jurisdictions, Article 16, on\nexclusive jurisdictions, and Article 17 on prorogation of jurisdiction;\nfinally, as far as recognition and enforcement are concerned, analysis\nof the conditions of recognition (notably Article 27). Some of these ar-\nguments were thoroughly dealt with in the early years, so that case law\nhas stabilized over the last years. However, there are still some open\nquestions (for example, those resulting from Article 5).\n\nThe Court's case law is of a practical kind, which is not made to\nplease lawyers particularly (especially the \"continental\" ones), if they\nare more formalist and used to extremely precise definitions of con-\ncepts, and to subtle arguments. But, after all, the Court has not been\nwrong to be bound more by practical necessity and equity, than by for-\nmalism. And if there are some points, on which the Court's attitude\nmay not escape criticism, the positive comments are certainly more\nnumerous. The general evaluation of the Court's case law must there-\nfore be favourable. On the other hand, confronted with texts which\nhave continually been changing and evolving, the Court's task has been\ndifficult. It could not seem logical to insist at all costs on a strict and\nrigid interpretation of norms themselves destined to be changed within\na short time. One may therefore judge that the Court's attitude, an-\nticipating in its case law the application of new texts, has been useful\nin facilitating the change from one text of the Convention to the next.\n\nNevertheless, we must now hope that this phase of adjustment and\nsorting out of the text is finished, and that the Court may begin to carry\nout its task in relation to a definitive text, in a climate of stability, which\nseems necessary at this stage.",

It examines the broad spectrum of ways in which the Court deals\nwith secondary law, considering in particular the extent to which the\nCourt allows the passage of secondary legislation to affect its reading of\nprimary law. The case law of the Court is difficult to predict, and difficult\nto evaluate. The “proper” relationship between primary and secondary\nlaw depends on one’s assessment of the “legal” or “political” nature of\nthe EU’s constitutional settlement, and on one’s views about the\nrelationship between, and legitimacy of, the judiciary and the legislature\nat EU level.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\nThis article aims to provoke the reader into thinking about the relationship\nbetween primary and secondary law in the EU, as it emerges from the case law\nof the European Court of Justice.The main aim is to illustrate the effect which\nthe passage of secondary legislation (regulations, directives, etc.) may have on\nthe case law of the Court interpreting primary law (both the Treaties and\ngeneral principles of EU law).1 Most lawyers would, at first blush, assume that\nthere is a simple hierarchical relationship between primary and secondary law,\nthat primary law does and should take priority over secondary law, and that\nthe adoption of secondary legislation should not affect the way in which\nprimary law is interpreted. Political scientists on the other hand, might expect\nthe passage of legislation to have a greater impact on the case law of the Court.\n\nThe somewhat confused reality which this article exposes, illuminates the\ntensions between the judiciary and the legislature in the EU, and between what\nmay be termed the “legal” or “political” nature of the EU’s constitutional\n* University of Bristol. I would like to thank Diego Acosta, Gareth Davies, James\nKolaczkowski, Akis Psygkas, Julian Rivers, and the anonymous referees.\n\n1. See also Davies, “Legislative control of the European Court of Justice”, 51 CML Rev.\n(2014), 1579.\n\nCML Rev. 2015\nSyrpis\n462\n\nsettlement.The hope is that this article will provoke further academic research\ninto the “proper” relationship between primary and secondary law; and that, in\ntime, the approach of the judiciary to legislative interventions of various sorts\nmay become more consistent and easier to predict.\n\nOne of the main insights of this contribution is that the presence of\nsecondary legislation is, in certain cases at least, prone to influence the case\nlaw of the Court of Justice relating to the interpretation of particular\nprovisions of the Treaties. However, in other cases, it seems that the passage of\nlegislation has no, or next to no, impact on the case law of the Court.There are\nhuge inconsistencies in the Court’s approach, and these have important\nconstitutional ramifications. Depending on one’s perspective as to the\n“proper” relationship between the judiciary and the legislature, one will be\nlikely to have different views as to the extent to which the passage of\nlegislation should be able to influence the Court’s reading of the primary law.\n\nThe potential subject matter of this article is vast.The article begins with an\nexplanation of the context in which EU secondary legislation is adopted.\n\nNext, it illustrates the nature of the relationship between primary and\nsecondar",

         "which went beyond the case before the Court. The Court has under-\nlined the significance of this point of view in holding that the obliga-\ntion contained in Article I 77 (3) may become nugatory if the question\nraised is identical to questions that have already been decided. In this\nway the supreme national courts are spared the need to address them-\nselves to the Luxembourg Court on merely repetitive questions of\ninterpretation. On the other hand it was expressly declared that the\nmunicipal judges have always the right to make such reference should\nthey consider it desirable, e.g., if they have doubts about the contents\nand exact meaning of previous preliminary rulings.\nN A T I O N A L  LAWS A N D  T H E  L A W  O F  T H E  C O M M U N I T I E S\nI N  T H E  P R O C E D U R E  O F  T H E  C O U R T  AT L U X E M B O U R G\nThe form of procedure itself needs little comment. A case starts\nwith written proceedings in which the complaint, the defence, the\nreply, and the rejoinder are exchanged; if necessary this is followed\nby a decision on interlocutory matters requiring investigation, or else\nthe oral proceedings follow immediately. This oral hearing ends\nwith the conclusions of the advocate-general.\n\nMore interesting is the fact that all jurists belonging to the bar of\ntheir respective countries may plead before the Court. Particularly\nin view of the conditions in Germany there is even the right of pro-\nfessors of law to plead if they are permitted to do so in their own local\ncourts. No problems of any importance have so far been encountered\nas to who can be admitted as an advocate. If Great Britain joined,\nsome difficulties would no doubt arise because of the distinction\nbetween barristers and solicitors.\n\nMeanwhile it is of great importance that the various parties and\ntheir advisers have access to the Court, in that they are allowed to\nplead in one of the four official languages of the Community. In\ngeneral the choice of language lies with the plaintiff and not with\nthe defendant. The reason for this is that in nearly every case the\ndefendant is one of the institutions of the Community, in most\ninstances one of the executives, and these are deemed to have equal\ncommand of all four languages. Only when the defendant is a mem-\nber state is the rule reversed, and the hearing conducted in the lan-\nguage of the defendant.\n\nThis rule in fact ensures equal'access to the Court by the bar of\neach of the six countries.\n\nAn enterprise which wishes to appeal to the Court may appoint an\nadvocate of its own nationality. The latter will submit a complaint\nin his own language, and the defending institution will in most cases\n\nappoint an advocate of the same nationality, or appoint one of its\nofficials of that nationality as its agent. The proceedings take place\nentirely in the language chosen, and the Court gives judgment in the\nsame language even though this judgment is translated into the other\nthree languages.\n\nIn most cases no problems arise as to the implementation of the\nCourt's declarations of annulment of decisions made by executives.\n\nWhere this is the case no further action concerning implementation\nneed be taken. In some cases, however, the judgment consists of the\nimposition of a fine or the award of damages. In such cases the Treaties\nprovide that the decision of the Court is to be submitted to the\nMinister of Justice of the member state where the judgment is to\nbe executed. He simply confirms the authenticity of the judgment\nwhich the local appropriate court then executes in the same way\nas if it were executing one of its own judgments.",

It goes beyond the present In-\ndustrial Property Convention of 1883, which, for all its achievements\nin respect of reciprocity and uniformity of -patent rights, is based\non nationaI protection. The essential basis of an international system\nmust be a central patent office which will issue patents having, if\nvalid, the force of law in all member countries of the system. The\nadvantages to industry of any such system are manifest and, if the\nproposed European Patent Convention were to achieve nothing more,\nit would be justified by the saving of much of the time and expense at\npresent involved in obtaining patents in the individual countries.\n\nIn fact, of course, the Draft Convention aims to achieve much more\nthan this. Nevertheless, the introduction of a patent with international\nforce would be such an important achievement that it is to be hoped\nthat this will not be limited, still less prevented, by any over-rigid\ninsistence on carrying the idea to its full logical conclusion. There must\nat this stage be some compromises.\n\nSince the institution of a European Patent Office necessarily lies at\nthe core of a European patent scheme, the Draft Convention has been\nmuch influenced by the views and experience of officials of the Patent\nOffices of the six countries. This was inevitable and may account for\nthe fact that, while the Draft is detailed and generally admirable in\nits cover of patent office organisation and practice, its approach to\ngeneral patent law is Iess well thought out and, unless substantially\namended in some important respects, is unlikely to be regarded as\nsatisfactory. The main difficulties in evolving a satisfactory and more\nwidely accepted system are likely to be found in certain aspects of\npatent law, particularly affecting granted patents and their enforce-\nment, with which it is the purpose of this article to deal. Considera-\ntion will, therefore, be given to the following matters :\n\nI. Provisional and Final Patents.\n\n2. The Patent Specification.\n3. Infringement.\n\nI. Published in the four official languages by the Publication Service of the Euro-\npean Communities. Available in English from the Stationery Office (51-).\n\n4. Patentability.\n\n5. Available Prior Art.\n\n6. Validity.\n\n7. Amendment of Specifications.\n\n8. Enforcement of Patent Rights.\n\n9. Dual Protection.\n\nI o. General Conclusions.\n\nI. P R O V I S I O N A L  AND F I N A L  P A T E N T S\nOne of the first questions the Committee had to face was whether to\nmake the grant of a patent dependent on proof of novelty and invention\nover the prior art revealed by a patent office search. There was also\nthe related question of opposition to grant by interested parties.\n\nA system in which patents are granted without proof of novelty has\nthe merit that protection is obtained without much delay. The public\nare kept informed about current inventions and the patentee is in a\nposition to enforce his rights before infringers have made much head-\nway. The drawback is that the specification is often framed without\nadequate knowledge of the prior art. This must either mean frequent\namendment of specifications at a later stage or impose a method of\nadjudication of patent right which involves an ad hoe determination\nof the novel features of the invention over the prior art put",

Rules of procedure and\nquestions of jurisdiction are regarded as dull and trivial matters.\n\nThe more experience they have however in the practical application\nof the law, the more they recognise that these questions are at least\nas important as the positive rules of law themselves. Wise laws may\nbe robbed of their effectiveness through conflicts of jurisdiction and\nbad administration, and competent officials may achieve much\nfrom indifferent laws. This is particularly valid in the case of cornpeti-\ntion law: The much disputed question whether there should be an\nabsolute prohibition or merely control of abuses is in reality not nearly\nso important, it is at least as important to know which authorities\nare competent, what powers they have and what they do with them.\n\nThe distribution of powers in every state is a delicate problem.\n\nThis is particularly true for a federal system where there is alongside\nor above the power of the member states a second independent force,\nthe federal government. Within the European Economic Community\nwe Germans understand particularly the perpetual struggle that goes\non between the Federal Government and the Lander over the proper\ndistribution of rights and duties. There has not been a German consti-\ntution in the last hundred years that has not had a long list of articles\ndealing with the allocation of powers. The Treaty of Rome has not\nonly transferred numerous functions from the member states to the\nCommunity, but has also given the Community its own institutions\nand powers which are independent of the governments of the member\nstates. The E.E.C. contains accordingly the first foundations towards\na European federation. Therefore as positive decisions come to be taken\nall the more importance must be attached to the question as to how\nfar the member states shall be given competence in respect of particular\nlegislative and administrative functions.\n\nCompetition policy is to-day one of the most important problems\nof the Community. It must prevent that on the one hand the most\nserious restraints of trade by states within the Common Market are\nremoved, but on the other hand are substituted by fresh state subsidies\n30\n\nor private restrictions. The success or failure in this respect for the\ndevelopment of the Community in such a vital sector depends not only\non whether the proper substantive rules are made or will be later laid\ndown, but also on those who are to be responsible for the application\nof the rules and, when there are several authorities, that the powers\nbetween them are properly distributed. An over-emphasis of the central\nauthority may further the unity of competition policy, but reduce its\neffectiveness through over-centralisation. O n  the other hand too\ngreat a decentralisation may tend to the disintegration of the new\nCommunity law and permit national attitudes and interests to ride\ninto the foreground. For this reason the powers between the Com-\nmunity and the member states must be balanced so that an effective\nCommunity-like competition policy becomes possible.\n\nInterlinked with the problem of the division of powers there is a\nfurther question, namely the relationship between Co",

ANTAL\nProfessor of Law at Leyden University\nOn October g ~ s t  1962 the Commission of the European Economic\nCommunity published a set of draft directives concerning the har-\nmonisation of turnover taxes within the framework of the Common\nMarket. This article takes a first look at these directives. Part I briefly\nreviews some facts of the problems with which these directives deal.\n\nIn Part I1 a finding is presented as to what in my opinion should be the\nconcept of the harmonisation of turnover taxes within the framework of\nthe Treaty of Rome. Part I11 examines the directives of the Commis-\nsion in the light of the views set out in Parts I and 11.\n\nI. T H E  P R O B L E M  A N D  ITS A S P E C T S\nGeneral\nArticle gg ( I )  of the Treaty of Rome of the 25th March 1957 stipulates\nthat the Commission is to investigate how the member states' legisla-\ntion concerning turnover taxes among other things could be harmo-\nnised in the interests of the Common Market. The Commission\ncomplied with this mandate.2 It drew up a set of draft directives\nwhich were laid before the Council of Ministers by virtue of Article 99\n(2). The Council has to give its decision by unanimous vote. The\nprocedure to be followed is based on Article IOO of the Treaty, which\nmeans that this decision will need the advice of the European Parlia-\nment and the Economic and Social Committee.\n\nThe term harmonisation chosen in Article gg ( I )  of the Treaty is\nvague. It must be pointed out at once though, that the Treaty does not\n\nI. Article gg reads:\n\"The Commission shall consider how to further the interests of the Common Market\nby harmonising the legislation of the various Member States concerning turnover\ntaxes, excise duties and other forms of indirect taxation, including compensatory\nmeasures in respect of trade between Member States.\n\nThe Commission shall submit proposals to the Council; the latter shall decide upon\nthe matter unanimously without prejudice to the provisions of Articles IOO and 101.\"\n2 .  The draft directives which have now been published rest on a comprehensive\nstudy at official level. The results of part of this study have been laid down in the\nGeneral Report of the Sub-groups A, B and C which were set up in order to study\nthe various possibilities of harmonisation of turnover taxes. The report drawn up by\nthe Neumark Commission-called\nafter its chairman-which\ndoes not consist of\nofficials, promises to be more essentially interesting. At the time of writing, the final\ntext of this report was not definitively established and was not, therefore, available.\n\nprescribe-as\nwould seem clear-that\nturnover taxes must be unified,\nwhich would mean that all participating states would have to introduce\none system of taxation with uniform rates and uniform exemptions.\n\nThe aims of the Treaty must form, of course, the basis of a meaning-\nful interpretation of the term harmonisation. In so far as they are\ndirectly connected with turnover taxes, these aims consist of the estab-\nlishment of a common market in which goods and services can cir-\nculate freely without artificial distortions of the competitive  force^.^\nI n  the light of this objective the following description by Dr.\n\nRadler, for instance, seems acceptable: \"Harmonisation should be\nunderstood as the partial modification of the national legal systems\nwith the aim of eliminating permanent institutional sources which\ndistort the action of free competitive forces, and facilitating trade\nacross the  frontier^\".^ R",

PENNINGTON\nSolicitor; Senior Lecturer in Commercial Law at Birmingham University\nThe legislative reform of company law in any country is a cyclical\nprocess. In Great Britain the cycles seem to be of shorter duration\nthan in other parts of Europe, for it is only fifteen years since the\nlegislation at present in force, the Companies Act, 1948, was enacted.\n\nand the two previous general revisions of company law took effect at\nintervals of nineteen years and twenty-one years respectively. In\nEurope the cycle seems to be of some thirty years duration. The\nGerman legislature is at present considering a bill which revises\nexhaustively the law of 1937 governing public companies, and when\nthis has been enacted, there will probably follow a bill to modernise\nthe law of 1892 relating to private companies. In France and Belgium\nimportant reforms to the legislation of the 1930's are presently under\nconsideration. In Italy the only proposal currently before the legis-\nlature is one to raise the minimum capital of private companies from\n50,000 to one and a half million lire, but since the present Italian\nlegislation was enacted as recently as 1942, perhaps the cycle for a\ngeneral or extensive revision of the law is as yet incomplete.\n\nProposals for company law reform in Great Britain have not yet\nbeen embodied in a bill presented to Parliament. As yet there has\nonly been published the Report of the Company Law Committee1\n(usually known as the Jenkins Committee from the name of its\nchairman), which listened to submissions and considered memoranda\nby professional and other bodies and by individuals during 1960 and\n1961, and presented its report embodying its recommendations for\nreform in the summer of last year. These recommendations will\nundoubtedly form the basis of the new legislation which will probably\nbe exacted during 1965 or 1966, and the Jenkins Report therefore\ndeserves the closest study by those who are interested in current devel-\nopments in Great Britain. The use of a committee of lawyers, ac-\ncountants, economists, businessmen and trade union representatives\nlike the Jenkins Committee is, incidentally, illustrative of the British\napproach to the reform of business law, and explains many of the\ndifferences of outlook and emphasis found here and in Europe. On\nthe whole business law (that is the law relating to business organisation\nand transactions and to such matters as industrial property rights)\nis regarded as technical and non political, and the preparatory work\nfor its revision is usually undertaken by an expert committee which\nI .  Cmnd. 1749. London H.M.S.O. I as.6d.\n\n58\n\nis representative of all strata of commerce and society generally,\nand not simply of the political parties. The result of this outlook is\nthat the committee concerns itself wholly with problems of improving\nthe efficiency of the law and doing justice in particular instances\nbetween the interested parties, and not at all with basic political and\nsocial principles. Parliament's approach, too, is the same, and it\nregards its function as being primarily to review the recommenda-\ntions of the committee in the light of professional and other informed\nopinion, rather than to initiate reforms. This procedure contrasts\nmarkedly with the history of the bill at present before the German\nlegislature for the reform of the law governing public companies.\n\nThis bill is the third attempt at such legislation, the first two drafts\nbeing a Government bill which was not proceeded with and a bill\ndrafted by Government",

         "PROFESSIONAL CONFIDENCE\n\nFRANCIS\nBARNES\nBarrister-at-Law, London\nThe purpose of this note is to explore the area of divergence between\nEnglish and continental legal systems relating to the right of the\nlay-client to have preserved the confidence of his communications\nwith his lawyers.\n\nThe basic difference is that on the continent the privilege is the\nlawyer's, whereas in England it is the client's. In England, therefore,\nthe client can, if he wishes, restrain his barrister or solicitor from mak-\ning disclosure of matters to which professional confidence attaches,\nequally, if he wishes, he can waive his privilege and authorize dis-\nclosure. Unless or until such authority is given, it is the lawyer's\nduty at all times to respect and, if necessary, assert his client's privilege.\n\nAs to the matters to which such privilege attaches, these are all\ncommunications coming to the barrister or solicitor, whether directly\nor indirectly, in the course of his professional handling of the case,\nand all advices given by the lawyer to the client upon the same.\n\nIt is not pre-requisite that litigation should be contemplated, but it is\nnecessary that the lawyer should be consulted professionally as such,\nand not informally as a friend who happens to have some legal know-\nledge or experience. To this basic rule there are two exceptions and\none qualification.\n\nThe main exception is when such communications are made not\nfor the bonajide purpose of taking legal advice or promoting or resisting\nlitigation, but for the furtherance of some fraud or crime. This ex-\nception is not easy to define, but it is safe to say that the Court would\nrequire a prima facie case of such fraud or crime to be made out on the\nevidence before it, before it would permit the client's apparent pri-\nvilege to be overridden: it would not be enough merely to state such\nfraudulent or criminal purpose in a pleading or an opening stateme3t.l\nThe second exception concerns the somewhat narrow field of\npersons such as marriage guidance counsellors, or lawyers or clergy-\nmen or even doctors engaged in the reconciliation or attempted re-\nconciliation of estranged married partners.? There is no Court pro-\nI .  A clear example of loss of the privilege would be where a person intending to\nperpetrate a future fraud or crime went to a lawyer to seek advice upon how he could\nbest perpetrate it, or perpetrate it with the.least risk of detection-see\nStephens,\nJ., giving the judgement of the Court of Crown Cases Reserved in Cox and Railton\n(1884) 14 Q.B.D. 153.

Article ?I, on the other hand,\ncertainly leads to the same conclusions as Article I 2.\n\nThe second comment is connected with this last po7nt. The presant decision has\nalready been taken in respect of Article 31 by the Ttalian Council of State in its\njudgment 7781962 of 17 November 1961 (published in November 19621 The most\nimportant part of the considerations follow hereunder from the French translation:\n\"In this respect it must be pointed out that while the Act of 14 November 1957\nno. 1203 authorises the ratification and full and entire implementation of the Inter-\nnational Treaties of Rome of 25 March 1957, of which the E.E.C. Treaty is one,\nfor the implementation of Article 31 of the Treaty (prohibition to introduce any\nnew quantitative restrictions or measures having equivalent effect) no other internal\nmeasures of Italian law were necessary,' as lists of liberated products had already\nbeen compiled in pursuance of the decisions of the Council of the OECD already\nmentioned. In fact, with the ratification and putting into force of the Treaty of\nRome our legal system has acquired the very provision which prevents alteration of\nthe list of consolidated products already liberated, in accordance with Article 31\nby virtue of which the citizen who has been directly wronged by an importation\n\nrefusal (on the basis of a ministerial circular) can contest such a measure together\nwith the circular on which it has been based, in the absence of a legislative measure\nauthorising this restriction. Moreover the E.E.C. Treaty contemplates that the\nprovisions of the Treaty can be invoked not only by the member states or by the\norgans or institutions of the Community, but also by natural or legal persons affected\n(e.g. Article 173 (2), and it also provides for the possibility of litigation on the inter-\npretation of the Treaty before the municipal courts of the various Member-States,\nin accordance with the line of conduct adopted by the latest international organisa-\ntions, in favour of which the states consent to restrict the principle of political auto-\nnomy and to limit their sovereignty in the interests of international cooperation (see\nalso Article I I of the Constitution).\n\nIt is therefore acknowledged that the import licencing of product beta I, and in\nconsequence the regulation of 24 November 1960, is illegal.\"\nThis ruling and the late date at which it comes to the-knowledge of interested ju-\nrists, demonstrates the need for a documentation at Community level of national,\njudicial and administrative decisions which are of immediate interest in the applica-\ntion of Community law. The initiative to start this documentation had already been\ntaken within the Community some considerable time ago. The Community itself\nhas a duty in this respect to co-ordinate the decisions taken in the Member-States,\nand it is hoped that as a matter of urgency an official documentation service will\nbe started without further delay.\n\nSk.",

This common agricultural policy, whose objectives\nare specified in Article 39, is to be gradually developed during the\ntransitional period by the  member-States and brought into force not\nlater than at the end of that period (Article 40 ( I )  ).\n\nThe chief instrument of the common agricultural policy is the com-\nmon organisation of agricultural markets. Such common organisation\nis to be set up, in accordance with Article 40 ( 2 )  \"in order to achieve\nthe objectives set out in Article 39\". In the terms of Article 40 (3), this\ncommon organisation \"may include all measures required to achieve\nthe objectives set out in Article 39, in particular price controls,\nsubsidies for the production and distribution of various products,\nmeasures of stock-piling and carry-forward, and a common mecanism\nfor the stabilisation of imports and exports\". In order to permit the\ncommon organisation to function, Article 40 (4) provides for the\nestablishment of \"agricultural orientation and guarantee funds\".\n\nMoreover, it is within the framework of the provisions and in accor-\ndance with the procedure provided for the replacement of national\norganisations by the common organisation that the Council must\ndetermine to what extent the chapter of the Treaty dealing with\nthe rules of competition is to apply to the production of, and trade\nin, agricultural products (Article 42).\n\nIn order to develop and establish the common agricultural policy\nArticle 43 fixes a procedure in three phases:\n\n(a) A conference of Member-States convened by the Commission\nimmediately after the coming into force of the Treaty, in order to\ncompare their respective agricultural policies.\n\n(b) The submission of proposals by the Commission, after consul-\ntation with the Economic and social Committee, within two years\nfrom the date of the coming into force of the Treaty, such proposals\nhaving taken into account all the matters raised in the agricultural\nsection of the Treaty,\n(c) On the proposal of the Commission and after the consultation\nI 18\n\nwith the European Parliament, the Council will adopt the necessary\nregulations, directives or decisions.

DRION\nProfessor of Law at Leyden Uniaersity\nIt is probably still possible for a tough reader to read all that has been\nwritten on Articles 85 and 86 of the Rome Treaty. If so, the following\ncomments should perhaps have been better written 25 years later,\nat a time when the author could not seriously be blamed for not having\nworked through all the literature on this fascinating subject. From\nonly fr-om that point of view-the\npresent\nthat point of view-but\ncontribution might be said to be in advance of its time.\n\nArticles 85 to go clearly purport to elaborate the principle laid\ndown in Article 3 (f), in which it is said that one of the activities of the\nCommunity shall be \"the establishment of a system ensuring that\ncompetition in the Common Market is not distorted\". The principles\nof Article 3 are stated as the means for furthering the ends of the Com-\nmunity as formulated in Article 2.a0bviously, not all the ideals of\nArticle 2 are necessarily aimed at by each one of the principles con-\ntained in Article 3. The principle of undistorted competition seems\nto be related to the ideals of \"a harmonious development of economic\nactivities\" within the Community, of \"continuous and balanced\nexpansion\", of \"an accelerated raising of the standard of living\",\nand perhaps also to that of \"increased stability\". It would be wrong,\nhowever, to attach such significa~ce to the relation between Articles 2\nand 3, that the principles of Article 3 should be construed strictly\nwithin the limits of the aims set out in Article 2. Surely, the demo-\ncratic ideal of respect f ~ r\nthe individual citizen, his wishes and even his\nwhims, has also been a factor in the drive for undistorted competition.\n\nWhy is a system of competition considered a useful and even a neces-\nsary means for promoting these ideals? It would be dangerous to looli\nfor an answer to this question to one of the various economic theories.\n\nThe EEC Treaty is not based on one economic theory. It is rather in\nthe common stock of experiences, traditions and, perhaps, prejudices\nof the Western world, that we must try to find the assumptions under-\nlying the principle of free competition, leaving aside what is contro-\nversial amongst those who believe in that principle.\n\nIt requires the innocence of somebody thoroughly unfzmiliar\nwith economic theory to suggest a neutral formula for the said under-\nlying assumptions. Perhaps the following might qualify for the pur-\npose of these observations :\n\n148\n\n( I )  The assumption that a system of competition offers the best\nmethod to satisfy in the best possible way the numerous and increasing-\nly varied needs of individuals and groups and of the entire community\nin our complex modern society.\n(2) The assumption that by means of the price mechanism a system\nof competition offers the best, and possibly the only, method of\nevaluating those needs in an objective way.\n\nWith respect to the Rome Treaty a third aspect of the principle of\nundistorted competition has, no doubt, played a r81e: breaking down\nthe !egal walls between the national economies of the member coun-\ntries would be of little avail, if private industry and business continued\nto respect those national frontiers by way of private agreements or\nconcerted practices.\n\nBefore applying these assumptions to the interpretation of Article 85,\nit seems worthwhile to say a few words on the lines of demarcation be-\ntween that article and Article 86. Both articles deal with distortions\nof normal competition. In Article 86 the distortion",

B A S I C  FACTS\nThe Association of Overseas Countries and Territories-Part\nIVof the\nTreaty of Rome-can\nonly be understood in the light of post-war\nFrench colonial policy.\n\nThe economic and monetary system of the Franc Area has to a\nvery large degree been centralised and autarchic. Roughly 75%\nof all trade of the French-speaking African countries was in 1956\nconfined to the Franc Area. This trade follows the policy of the\n\"barter\" of tropical products for French industrial products. Both\nsides trade their products at prices above the world level. French\nimports have been protected by centralised currency control, by\nquantative restrictions on third country imports and by the monopoly\nof French commercial firms and banks. France protected the sale\nof tropical products from the African countries on her market through\nimportant-\npreferential tariffs, quantative restrictions, and-most\nby guaranteed prices for predetermined quantities. So-called \"caisses\nde stabilisation\" were founded, price stabilisation schemes for the pur-\npose of protecting the indigenous producers from price fluctuations\non the world-market. The guaranteed prices in the French market\nmade the operation of these schemes fairly easy. The \"caisses de stabili-\nsation\" guarantee the farmers a fixed price before the crop is under\nway. Private traders collect the products and handle the payment of\nadvances to farmers. The \"caisses de stabilisation\" take care of the sale\nto France and on the world market. This system has led to the\nso-called ''surkrix\" of the Franc Area: prices are from 15% (cot-\nton) to 60% (coffee) above the world level. It is not surprising\nthat in such a hothouse atmosphere production tends to concentrate\non the protected products, even where conditions would be better\nsuited for the production of others. The economies of the French-\nspeaking countries have thus become based cn the export of' very few\n* The author studied law and politics at the University of Leyden.

(Harvard),\nLecturer in Cornparatice Constitutional Law, University of Edinburgh\n\nA paper delivered to the University of Edinburgh European\nCommunity Studies Group on May 17, 1963\nI t  would appear that although this is the age of the reader's digest\nand the condensed book, yet as far as our constitutional texts are\nconcerned, the struggle for certainty of meaning results not in clarity\nand conciseness of expression, but in ever-increasing verbosity. The\nTreaties of Paris and Rome are no exception. With their hundreds of\nArticles, Protocols, and Annexes, they follow the inflationary trend\naway from the elegant simplicity of the United States Constitution, a\ntrend which was initiated by the British North America Act of 1867,\nand continued by the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act\nof 1900. Nonetheless, the fundamental principles involved have\naltered very little over the years, and it is my object here to try to\ndemonstrate that the European Community Treaties merely spell out\ni n  perhaps excessive detail some of the concepts which are expressed\nmore shortly in the American, Canadian, and Australian constitutions,\nand subsequently expanded in application by their common law courts.\n\nIn regard to trade and commerce between the member states of\nthese various unions we may express the basic objective of all these\ndocuments as being to provide for the orderly regulation of that trade\nand commerce concomitant with its \"freedom\". Freedom is an un-\ncertain concept whose meaning may vary from age to age, but itis\nclear that regulation and freedom are compatible. As Lord Wright\nsaid in James v. The Commonwealth,'\n\" ' Free' in itself is vague and indeterminate. It must take its colour from thecont-\ntext . . . ; it means freedom governed by law . . .\"\n\nI. [1g36] A.C. 578, 631 (P.C.).\n\nand as Lord Porter declared in The Conzmonwealth v. Bank of New South\nWales, (The Bank Nationalisation Case),\n\"The problem to be solved will often be not so much legal as political, social, or\neconomic, yet it must be solved by a court of law.\"\nConsequently, whatever the terms \"freedom\" and \"regulation\" may\nbe held to mean in specific cases, we can at least say this-that\nin a\nfederal union-under\nwhich heading we may here include the\nEuropean Communities-the\ntask of the judicial branch of govern-\nment is to review exercises of legislative power, both federal and state,\nin the light of whether that legislation impairs a balance between (I)\neconomic freedom of competition, (2) the protection of local state\nautonomy, and (3) a measure of federal uniformity of regulation.\n\nThus, for example, in relation to Article 37 of the ECSC  treat^,^\nthe European Court of Justice declared in Nos. 2 & 3/60, flieder-\nrheiniscf~e Bergwerks-Aktiengesellschaft c.

HAARDT\nProfess07 of Law at Leyden University\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\nOne of the most interesting phenomena in the development of a\n\"European law\" is perhaps the attempt to establish a \"European\npatent\".\n\nThe Draft Convention relating to a European Patent Law compiled\nby a study group set up by the Governments of the six E.E.C. countries,\nand published in French and German in November 1962, aroused\nwide interest.l The Draft comprises 2 17 articles and is without a doubt\na well thought-out and competent piece of work which shows vast\nexperience of the subject on the part of the compilers. It does lack,\nthough, in many places comment as to their intent.

Beside these European patents it will still be possible to obtain\nnational patents according to the legislation of the Contracting States,\nbut in the thinking of the compilers of this Draft after some years\nthese national patents will lose their importance.\n\nThe granting of a European patent will be preceded by the granting\nof a \"provisional patent\", after compliance with formal demands and\na novelty search. The final patent will only be granted on application\nmade within five years of the publication of the grant of the prc; isional\npatent, after a further search has been made. The patent iapses not\nlater than 2 0  years after filing the application.\n\nThe European Patent Office will be competent not only to grant\nEuropcan patents (whether provisional or otherwise) but also to give\ndecisions on requests for revocatioil of such patents, to produce\ntechnical opinions on questions of infringement of such patents at the\nrequest of the national courts, and to give declaratory rulings regarding\nquestions of infringement which will be binding on the national courts.\n\nI.

         "he matter can, however, be brought before\nthe Court of Justice in two ways, neither of which applies directly to decisions\ntaken by the judicial authorities of Member States.\n\n(a) Article I 72 of the Treaty provides that it is for Regulations laid down by the\nCouncil to confer on the Court of Justice full jurisdiction over appeals \"in respect\nof penalties provided for in such regulations\". And this is indeed what has been\ndone in Article 7 of Regulation No. 17, which provides that such appeals may\nbe brought against decisions of the Commission imposing a fine or a daily penalty\npayment, to have such fine or penalty set aside, reduced or increased.\n\nSuch an appeal to the full jurisdiction of the Court cannot be brought against\ndecisions taken by the authorities in Member States, on the one hand because\nArticle g (3) gives them the right to prohibit understandings and declare them\nnull and void, but not to impose fines or daily penalty payments, and on the other,\nbecause Article 17 makes only decisions by the Commission liable to appeals to\nthe full jurisdiction of the Court, which excludes decisions by the authorities in\nMember States.\n\n(b) Article 173 gives the European Court of Justice control over IegaIity, but\nsolely with respect to \"acts of the Council and the Commission other than recom-\nmendations or opinions\". Thus, lack of jurisdiction, breaches of substantial form,\ninfringements of the Treaty or misuse of power committed by the authorities of\nMember States is outside the European Court's control over legality and outside\nthe Court's power under Article 174 to declare such acts null and void.\n\nNor could it be otherwise, for the acts of the authorities in Member States are\nacts taken under the authority of the State, and as such, in principle, at present\nescape supranational control.\n\n(2) On the other hand, the Court's regulating power remains capable of being\nexercised by the indirect method of an interpretation of the Treaty or its Regu-\nlations, in terms of Article 177.\n\nWithout again going into what has already been said with regard to the insti-\ntution and applization of the system of interpretation (see the Note by the same\nauthor entitled \"Cour de Justice des CommunautCs\", 6 April 1952, D 1962. pp. 361\nand 362), it is suficient to recall that it is always open to any party to ask a national\ncourt in a Member State to ask for an interpretation of the Treaty or of acts of\nthe Institutions of the Community, i.e. their regulations. A lower court may accede\nto such a request but is not obliged to do so, while national courts from whose\ndecisions no appeal lies under the !aws of that cou-ntry are bound to acq~!iesce\ntherein.\n\n253\n\nIt is thus in this indirect form that the European Court's regulatory power\nover the direct application of Article 35 by national courts will become established.\n\nMoreover, it will be seen from the judgment reporred above that the U.N.E.F.\n\nCompany, which asked in the first place that judgment be suspended, which was\ngranted, had asked in the alternative that an interpretation of Article g (3) of\nRegulation No. 17 be sought from the European Court of Justice.\n\nIn the present case, as a consequence of tile suspension of judgment ordered by\nthe Appeal Court on 26 January 1963, the decision which the Commission will\ntake directly with regard to the validity or nullity of the contract entered into\nbetween Grundig and the \"Etablissements Consten\" will be binding on French\ncourts in respect of the action for unfair competition, whether such contract is\nupheld or not.\n\nJEAN ROBERT\nAvocnt ct In Cour de Porir",

Georgetown University Law Center\nI~lternational Trade, like nuclear energy and rockets and missiles,\nhas undergone a dramatic transformation in the past few years. It\nhas leaped from the financial weeklies and the second section of the\nNew York Times to the front pages, much as the atom has moved\nfrom the laboratory and the rocket from science fiction.\n\nOne of the minor results of this metamorphosis of International\nTrade from a seemingly dry and marginal aspect of the dismal science\nto one which is believed to have important consequences for the eco-\nnomic and political life of nations and peoples is that commentators\nhave a more difficult time of it. Time was when all that was required\nwas to explain what the American trade program strove to achieve\nand what tools had been made available to secure the objective, in\nfull confidence that all of it would be news, and that more would be\na surfeit.\n\nIt is doubtful that this would suffice today. The press and magazine\ncoverage given during the past two years to the progress of the Trade\nExpansion Act of 1962 through the Congress; to various of President\nde Gaulle's actions affecting international trade-to\nsay nothing of\nthe case of American chicken exports to Europe-these\nphenomena\nalmost require any commentator to peer into the future and guess\npublicly at least about the near future prospects for international\ntrade. It no longer seems sufficient to describe; it is necessary to\npredict. In any event, since it is more interesting, that is what will\nbe essayed. But in order to do it with any chance of avoiding misunder-\nstanding, it remains necessary at the outset to describe briefly where\nAmericans are at this moment in life of international trade, and\nwhat kind of developments Americans are seeking to promote.\n\nW H E R E  A M E R I C A  I S\nAmericans are in the twenty-ninth year of the Trade Agreements Pro-\ngram, about to enter the thirtieth. This program of reducing artificial\nbarriers to international trade through reciprocal reductions in tar-\niffs, which would be applied to the products of all nations, has had\nits forward movements, its periods of stagnation, its varying emphases\nof purposes as the years since 1934 have unfolded. Adopted in 1934.\n\nas one of a number of measures to increase production and employ-\n\nment through expansion of American exports, its principal rationale\nduring the immediate post-war period became that of providing a\nwider American market in which foreign countries, particularly Europe,\ncould expand their dollar earnings. As Europe recovered her economic\nstrength, and as her desire for economic and political independence\ndeveloped along the lines of the Common Market, so the principal\narguments for the Trade Agreements Program turned once again, in\nthe late 1950's and early 1g6o's, to the necessity for opening wider\nthe American market in order to bargain for continued access abroad\nof American exports.\n\nBut movement has not been confined to varying justifications\ncorresponding to economic change. There has been change in author-\nity granted, in safeguards imposed, and in negotiating method.\n\nA U T H O R I T Y  T O  R E D U C E  TARIFFS\nIn 1934 the President was authorized to negotiate 50 per cent reduc-\ntions in American tariffs in exchange for reciprocal reductions. In\n1945 he was authorized to make additional 50 per cent reductions\nin the then-existing rates of duty on the same basis. In 1955 authority\nwas ",

         "THE ENGLISH SYSTEM OF\nC I V I L  PROCEEDINGS\n\nMASTER I. H. J A C O B\nA Master of the Supreme Court, England\nThe main characteristic features of the English system of civil proceed-\nings in the High Court up to the stage of trial, in cases in which con-\ntested questions of fact arise for decision, may be summarised as follows :\n\nA. P R E - T R I A L  P R O C E D U R E\nA marked distinction is drawn between all the stages of the proceed-\nings before the trial, and the trial itself. Pre-trial procedure is designed\nto prepare the case for the trial; for this purpose, the Rules of Court\ngoverning procedural steps which must or may be taken by the parties\nbefore the trial are calculated :\n\n(i) to ensure that the questions or issues in dispute between the\nparties to be determined at the trial are defined with clarity and pre-\ncision ;\n(ii) to prevent either party from being taken by surprise at the trial\nas to the nature of the case and the documentary evidence in the\npossession of the other party;\n(iii) to enable the parties to prepare their cases for the trial as fully\nas possible;\nand (iv) to eliminate those cases which may be properly disposed of\nwithout trial.\n\nB. T R I A L\nThe trial is presided over by a single Judge, who will have taken no\npart in any of the pre-trial stages of the proceedings;= in very few\ncases, nowadays, he will sit with a jury. The whole trial is held in\npublic and in one continuous session, if necessary from day to day.\n\nThe witnesses are called and examined by the parties and not by the\nCourt, and their evidence is given orally in answer to oral questions\nput to them. As soon as the evidence is concluded, Counsel for both\nparties address oral arguments to the Judge, on both questions of\nfact and of law, and immediately after the conclusion of these argu-\n\nI. The trial judge may have heard an interlocutory appeal in the same case; this\nhappens very occasionally, by sheer accident or coincidence. The position is different\nin the Commercial Court, where the same Judge hears the pre-trial applications\nas well as the trial itself.\n\n\"4\n\nments the Judge delivers an oral extempore judgment, giving reasons\nfor his decision.2 If the trial is with a jury, Counsel address the\njury when the evidence is concluded, whereupon the Judge delivers a\nsumming-up of the case to the jury who, without dispersing, deliver\ntheir verdict.\n\nC. COSTS\nCosts follow the event, or in terms of a game, the loser pays; i.e. the\nwinning party recovers from the losing party nearly, but not quite,\nall the fees which he has to pay his own lawyers for their conduct of the\ncase. Thus, costs become an additional stake in the case, so that he\nwho succeeds in the action wins not only what was originally at stake\nbetween the parties but also the costs of the action. The amount of\nthe costs which the loser may have to pay cannot be stated or ascer-\ntained until the action is ended; for costs are calculated, not by re-\nference to the amount involved or recovered,3 but on the basis of what\nhas been reasonably and properly incurred for each step taken in the\nproceedings.\n\nD. R O L E  O F  T H E  C O U R T\nThe Court plays only a passive r81e in the conduct of civil litigation,\nso that every step throughout the whole course of the proceedings must\nbe taken on the initiative of one or other of the parties, and not of the\nCourt, which, save in very rare and exceptional circumstances, takes\nno step of its own motion.\n\nWe may now proceed to develop more fully each of these charac-\nteristic features, and thereby unfold, as it were, a panoramic view\nof the whole system ",

Treaty regarding\nthe relations between States and Regions.\n\nTo clarify the terms of the problem, it is recalled that the Treaty\nof Rome prohibits \"any aid granted by a member State or through\nState resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens\nto distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the pro-\nduction of certain goods\" (Article 92).\n\nIn relation to such prohibitions, the following Article 93 states\nthat \"The Commission shall, in conjunction with member States,\nsubmit to constant examination all systems of aids existing in those\nStates.\" The aforesaid action of the Commission tends to allow, in\nagreement with the principle of gradualness generally laid down by\nthe Treaty for the suppression of all legislation and interventions\nwhich obstruct the free circulation of goods, the progressive sup-\npression, change or harmonisation of the existing systems of aids in\norder to make them compatible with the principles of the Treaty. It\nmust be in fact noted that the prohibitions contained in Article 92\nare not absolute, but are subject to exceptions, the general rules of\nwhich are specified in paras. (2) and (3) of the same Article. An\n* Study published in Italy in I1 Foro Italiano, 1963, IV, 67.\n\nI. This case concerned the validity of a law dated 5th November, 1962, approved\nby the Sicilian Regional Assembly amending Regional Law No. 7 of 20th January,\n1961, which provided certain benefits to shipbuilding enterprises. The effect of\nthe amendment was to extend the time from five to seven years for the completion\nof ships qualifying for the subsidy. The Regional law was referred by the State\nCommissioner for the Region of Sicily to the Constitutional Court. Further in-\nformation as to the amendment had been requested by the E.E.C. Commission\nand this request was transmitted through the State authorities to the Region. The\nRegion of Sicily failed to comply with this request, and the Constitutional Court\naccordingly held that for procedural reasons the Region was not entitled to pass\nthe amendment and the amendment was declared unconstitutional. The Con-\nstitutional Court further declared that actions by regional bodies which involve\nviolations of the instructions given by the State in compliance with its international\nobligations are sufficient to justify a declaration that the regional law is uncon-\nstitutional. Broad legislative powers were delegated to the regions, but the regions\nwere not sovereign. They, therefore, had no authority to depart from the general\nprinciples of international law which were binding upon the State.\n\nexamination of the facts is, therefore, necessary to ascertain if, in\nthe first place, certain aids are permissible under certain conditions,\nand to what extent and, if not, to take steps for their gradual sup-\npression.\n\nIn relation to the powers given to the Commission (the executive\norgan of the Community) by Article 93 para. ( I ) ,  para. (2) of the\nsame Article (expressly referred to in the judgment) prescribes that\nthe Commission \"shall decide that the State concerned shall abolish\nor modify such aid within a time limit to be prescribed by the Com-\nmission.\" If the Commission believes that a project is",

These rules have been implemented by some regulations\n(based upon Article 87), the most important of which is Regulation\nNo. 17 of February 6, 1962.l\nThe enforcement of the anti-trust policy in its broadest sense in the\nEuropean Economic Community is mainly entrusted to the Com-\nmission, the executive, which investigates and rules upon infringe-\nments of the prohibitions against agreements etc. under ArticIe 85\nand the abuse of a dominant position under Article 86. Though the\nauthorities of the member States remain also competent to apply\nArticles 85 ( I )  and 86 of the Treaty, this provision is not regarded\nas having much significance in practice. First of all, the powers of the\nnational authorities cease as soon as the Commission has initiated\nany action. Furthermore the Commission has exclusive jurisdiction\nin the application of exemptions under Article 85 (3). AS enterprises\ncoming within the province of Article 85 are likely to invoke paragraph\n(3), even if only by way of alternative, it will usually be impossible\nto apply Article 85 ( I )  without consideration of Article 85 (3), thus\nmaking the intervention of the Commission ine~itable.~\nIn the exercise of its duties in the field of European Anti-trust Law,\nthe Commission has extensive powers. Not only does it have the power\nto undertake investigations of various kinds, but it is entitled to im-\npose substantial fines and penalities for infringements of Articles 85\nand 86 and for offences in connection with enquiries and investiga-\ntions. In practice this means that the Commission has to carry out\nthe duties of investigator, prosecutor and judge. It is true that deci-\nsions imposing fines are stated by the provisions of Article 15 (4) of\nRegulation No. 17 to have no penal character, but this is likeIy to\nhe of little consolation to those on whom they are imposed.\n\nIt must be added that there is an appeal to the Court of Justice,\nunder Article 173 of the Treaty, against all decisions of the Commis-\nsion; and such right of reference to the Court is enjoyed not only by\nthe member States and the Council, but also interested private per-\n* The author is an official of the E.E.C.

For weeks the columns of the daily press have been full of reports\nof the \"chicken war\" between the Community and the United States.\n\nFrom the outset it was settled that in the dispute between the Com-\nmunity and the United States, both in respect of quantity and value,\nonly relatively small amounts were in question. According to the\nAmerican administration's own statements, the total export of poultry,\nonly part of which goes to the Community, constitutes a bare 4%\nof its total poultry production; in 1962 some 53 million dollars'\nworth of American poultry was sold to the Community, whereas in\nthe same year it was found possible to export American farm produce\nto the Community to the value of at least 1000 million dollars.\n\nThe dispute concerning the import of poultry into the Community\ngains much more in significance from the fact that the American\nadministration considers poultry as a \"test case7' for the Community's\nattitude respecting the import of farm produce from third countries.\n\nIt is therefore worth while to subject the situation on the poultry\nmarket to a closer scrutiny.\n2 .  The consumption in poultry-meat within the Community in the\nlast decade, owing\n\n--on the one hand to the current rise in consumers' income,\n\n-on\nthe other hand to the money's worth of poultry as against other\nkinds of meat,\nhas increased considerably. Demand could be covered only partially\nby production within the Community; in the Federal Republic of\nGermany, in particular, home supply lagged far behind the demand.\n\nThe Community's requirements in respect of poultry therefore-\nto the extent that its own production did not suffice-were\ncovered\nby the imports from third countries. I n  recent years the main stream\nof imports has been directed towards the Federal Republic; of the\ntotal imports of poultry in the member States the Federal Republic\nhas taken about 95%. It therefore seems desirable to base the further\ndiscussions only on the imports into the Federal Republic, and to\nignore the imports to the rest of the member States. The traditional\n' T h e  author is an official of the E.E.C. Commission. He is entirely responsible\nfor the views here expressed.\n\nsuppliers of poultry always used to be the Netherlands, Denmark\nand, especially as regards geese, the States of the eastern bloc. I n\n1956, for the first time, the United States delivered a few tons of\npoultry to the Federal Republic. On the basis of the increasing\ndemand, the United States soon succeeded in enlarging this initially\nslight import figure.\n\n3. Before application of the price-adjustment levy introduced by\nRegulation No. 22 of the Council for the gradual establishment of a\nCommon Market organization for poultry-meat1 imports into the\nFederal Republic were taxed with a moderate ad valorem duty which\neventually, under the Customs entry 02.02, amounted to 10.5% for\nimports from member States and to 15.9% for imports from third\nco~ntries.~\nIt is true that poultry imports were liberalized only inso-\nfar as they did not come from the dollar area or from the eastern\nbloc. The imports of poultry from the dollar area were only to be\nliberalized on 30. June 1962. De facto, however, the poultry imports\nfrom this area were liberalized already by 18. April 1961.~\n4. The de facto liberalization of imports from the dollar area led to\na sharp increase in the export of poultry-meat, especially of exports\nof fattened poultry from the United States.

The general decision of the High Authority of September 7, 1960, in implemen-\ntation of Article 15 E.C.S.C.26, sets out the formal requirements to be fulfilled by a\ndecision of the High Authority. A decision which, on its face, contains a non-sub-\nstantial defect, but which otherwise fulfils all substantial requirements prescribed\nby the Treaty, may nonetheless be considered a formal decision.\n\n2. A decision must be described as an act of the collegiate body of the High\nAuthority.

It is further worth mention-\ning that Arts. 9, 12 and 16 cited by the court as well as Arts. 95 et Jrq. are merely\napplicable to intra-Community trade. As to imports from third countries there is\nnothing but the prohibition incorporated in Art. 20 ( I )  of Regulation No. 19 which\nis confined to customs duties and charges with equivalent effect. It follows that logic\ndemands two alternative courses of reasoning. Either: the compensatory turnover\ntax on tapioca flour constitutes a duty-like charge and is invalid with respect to\nimports both from countries of the E.E.C. and from third countries. Or: the com-\npensatory turnover tax is characterized as an internal charge with discriminatory\neffects; then the tax is unlawful with regard to intra-Community trade and one has\nto admit that there is a gap in the law as to imports from third countries.\n\n(b) Most interesting are the observations relative to the relationship between\nCommunity law and national law. According to the judgment Regulation No. 19\nconstitutes \"supranational\" law and is directly applicable in each member State.\n\nThe relationship between \"supranational\" and national law appears somewhat\nanalogous to the relationship between \"Federal law\" and \"Land law\".55 Since, in\ncase of a conflict, \"Federal law\" overrides \"Land law\", the same rule favours Com-\nmunity law. This means that the German tax law to this extent has to yield to\nRegulation No. 19.\n\nThe court's theory on this problem does not seem to enjoy common support.\n\nA considerable amount of doctrine in Germany as well as in other countries is to\nthe effect that, in the hierarchy of law, Community law equals a federal statute at\nbe~t.~6\nConflicts between two statutes are inter alia solved by the rule \"lex posterior\nderogat legi priori\". Consequently, domestic law may be invalidated by Community\nlaw and vice versa, the decisive factor being the date of promulgation.\n\nSince it preceded Regulation No. 19, the German tax law could have been\ninvalidated according to this rule. However, the court not using judicial self-restraint\naligned itself with an opposite views7 that gravitates towards placing Community\nlaw above federal statutes. This would mean that Community law over-rides the\ndomestic law in any case. Such a theory is obviously in line with the idea to secure\nas broad as possible a scope of application to the E.E.C.

The treaties for the establishment ofthe\nEuropean Economic Community, the European Coal and Steel Com-\nmunity and Euratom create the obligation for this integration, for\nthese embrace all fields of the economic and social life of the member\nStates.l It would not have been compatible with the concept of an\nall-embracing economic union to exclude any particular economic\nsector. The partners could only try to ensure that some parts of the\neconomic activities of the member States might be integrated to a\ncertain level in a special way. It remains to be seen what meaning\nthis has for transport, for which, together with agriculture, it was\nspecially designed.\n\nDuring the discussion about the \"how\" of European integration\nthere appeared from the start two important questions: Do the insti-\ntutions of the Community have to create a \"Common Transport\nMarket5'-or\nis it enough to have a \"Common Transport Policy\"?\n\nThis is not the mere battle of words it may seem. There are under-\nlying economic political contradictions. But, of course, it is doubtful\nwhether these opposites are sufficiently defined by these two expres-\nsions. The main point is to examine whether this antithesis of \"Com-\nmon Transport Market\" and \"Common Transport Policy\" is justified\nby the Treaty of Rome. Political and economic questions should\nnot be confused with problems of legal interpretation. Eut it is impor-\ntant to state on the basis of accepted legal principles which decisions\nhave already been taken in the Treaty of Rome in the economic\nfield and where and to what extent the institutions of the Communities\nstill have a discretion in respect of legislative and administrative\n* This contribution is based on an address given by the author on January 24, 1964,\nbefore the European Study Group of the Europa Instituut, Leiden.\n** The author is an official of the E.E.C., Commission.

If a comprehensive conception of the Treaties is taken as a starting point, it must\nbe understood that in the political discussion there must be not only a fusion of the\nexecutives (E.E.C. Commission, High Authority of the E.C.S.C., and the Euratom\nCommission). It will also be necessary to harmonize the Treaties, ensuring thereby\nthat there is no retreat from the process of integration.\n\nmatters. The Treaty is not \"neutral\" in political-economic fields.\n\nIt does not permit, in common parlance, economic nationalism or\ndictatorship by officials.\n\nIn speaking of political-economic decisions of the Treaty-that\nis\nthe legal regulation of political-economic acts-this\ndoes not mean\nthat scientific economic conceptions can be neglected in interpreting\nand putting the Treaty into practice. The contrary is the case. The\ndifficulties to which this may lead become specially obvious in respect\nof one of the essential transport provisions of the Treaty, namely h-\nticle 75. There is to be found the expression: \"The special circumstan-\nces of transport\" which have to be kept in mind, when exercising the\npowers given by this provision.\n\nThe expression: \"special circumstances of transport\" can only be\nunderstood in economic terms.

V E R L O R E N\nV A N  THEMAAT\nDirector-General of Competition of the E.E.G. Commission\nOn page 333 of his interesting article on patent licensing agreements\nin Belgian law1, Mr. Schrans puts forward the view that:\n\n\"It may be deduced from Article 36 of the E.E.C. Treaty that the\nnormal exploitation of industrial property rights as provided fbr or\nallowed by the various national legislations cannot be interfered\nwith through the application of the rules of competition of the E.E.C.\n\nTreaty\".\n\nAs the view that Article 36 is of importance in the interpretation\nof Article 85 in the subject under discussion recurs regularly in the\nliterature, it might be useful to point out that this view is in fact\nincorrect. The first sentence of Article 36 merely provides that\n\"The provisions of Articles 30 to 34 inclusive shall not preclude\nprohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit\njustified on the grounds of ... or the protection of industrial and com-\nmercial property\".\n\nThe second sentence of the article also restricts the operation of\nthese exceptions as far as Articles 30 to 34 inclusive are concerned.\n\nThe first sentence of Article 36 undoubtedly means that the absolute\nprohibition of quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures\nhaving similar effect contained in Article 30 et seq, do not for instance\nmake it impossible for a patent holder to prevent the import of the\nproducts concerned by imitators. The effect of Article 36, however,\nis expressly restricted to Articles 30 to 34 inclusive of the Treaty. It\ndoes not, therefore, prevent the harmonisation of the existing national\nlegislations on the grounds of Article 100 of the E.E.C. Treaty, which\nthe above writer advocates. On the other hand it is of no significance\nin the interpretation of Article 85 of the Treaty.\n\nThe interpretation which Mr. Schrans upholds in the sentence\nquoted at the beginning of this paper can therefore not be based on\nArticle 36. Although the Commission in its Declaration of December\n24, 1962 nevertheless goes a long way in the direction called for by\nhim, this view, according to the explanation following the Declaration,\n* This contribution has appeared before in Dutch in Sociaal Economische bvetgeving\n1963, p. 428. The article has subsequently given rise to a discussion in the French\nperiodical Le Droit et les Affairs, which has been reprinted in Sociaal Econornische\nWetgeuing, 1964, pp. 83-94.\n\nI.

In the affirmative case\nthe applicability of Article 85 (3) can, of course, be investigated in\naccordance with the rules of procedure and as a rule therefore after\napplication has been made.

In order to simplify the text I shall only speak of agreements between enterprises,\nimplying that the same rules apply to decisions by associations of enterprises and, if\npossible, to concerted practices.\n3. The Treaty itself provides for the nullity of a forbidden agreement. Municipal\nlaw decides whether and under what circumstances activities in violation of a self-\nexecuting provision of the Treaty entitle a person aggrieved to claim damages or an\ninjunction to stop these activities. This problem was recently discussed at the 2e\nColloque international de droit europCen, The Hague, October 24-26, 1963.\n\nThus many conflicts are conceivable, and actually have arisen, which\nhave to be settled by the courts of the member States.\n\nDomestic courts will have to apply Article 85. The national judge,\nthen, is confronted with the difficult question whether the agreement\nfalls within Article 85 (I). Solution of this question requires under-\nstanding of the range of the prohibition. I shall investigate, briefly,\nto what extent the national judge may refer the matter either to the\nEuropean Court of Justice or to the Commission.\n\nWhen an agreement is found to fall within Article 85 (I) it may\nnevertheless be legal either under Article 85 (3) or by application\nof the provision of transitional law contained in Article 7 of Regulation\nnr. 17. The Articles g (I) and 7 of the Regulation entrust the Commis-\nsion with the sole competence to declare the prohibition, contained\nin Article 85 (I), inapplicable, or to suspend its effects.\n\nThe domestic courts, consequently, have no competence to hold,\non a basis of ",

Thus the principle that a formal law prevails over\nordinances is reversed. Usually ordinances are designed to implement a formal law.\n\nIn this case, however, the German legislators issue formal laws in order to implement\nordinances of the Executive of the Community.\n\nArt. 24 of the Constitution by virtue of which \"the Federation (Bund) may, by\nlegislation, transfer sovereign powers to inter-governmental institutions\" does not\njustify these measures. Contrary to a theory advocated by certain authors the insti-\ntutions of the E.E.C. do not enjoy autonomous authority; instead they are confined\nto the exercise of those powers within the Federal Republic which are transferred. In\nmaking use of Art. 24 the Federal Government is bound to observe the principle of\nthe separation of powers including the rules that govern the delegation of power to\nthe Executive.

The carefully balanced constitutional system of the Federal Republic\nmust not be diluted from outside.\n\nThe Federal Republic will not be prevented by this ruling from meeting her\nobligations under the E.E.C. Treaty. There are two ways for a solution. The regu-\nlations necessary for achieving the aims of the Community may either be incorpo-\nrated in laws and ordinances which are issued by the competent German institutions\nin compliance with the standards of the Federal Constitution; alternatively, the\nEuropean Parliament may be transformed into a genuinely parliamentary insti-\ntution endowed with the power of issuing the necessary laws.\n\n2. The Federal Government is authorized to collect all types of customs duties. By\nway of contrast, its powers with regard to taxes are limited. The levy which is based\nupon the Absch5fifungserhebungsgesetz must be characterized as a tax. Since it can be\nsubsumed to none of the federal fiscal powers, the levy was not validly introduced.\n3. Assuming the Federal Government to be competent the Gesetz zur Durchfuhrzing\nder Verordnung Nr. rg (Getreide) (and the AbschiipSungserhebungsgesetz) would neverthe-\nless be invalid. Tax laws must clearly indicate under which circumstances and at\nwhich rate a charge is due. This particularity is lacking. Both statutes do not show\nwhich merchandise will be charged and which amount of the levy will have to be\npaid. All these questions are unduly left to the determination of the Council and\nother executive institutions.\n\nGERHARD\nRIEHLE\nUniversity of\nTiibingen",

         "THE COMMUNITY -AND THE N E U T R A L  S T A T E S\n\nAssistant Director, British Institute of International and Comparative Law, London\nThe sixth year of the Community's existence, which ended on Decem-\nber 31, 1963, saw a number of remarkable developments in the field\nof the Community's external relations. On the positive side, the new\nassociation convention with 18 independent African States, signed in\nUaoundC, Cameroun, on July 20, 1963, and the association agreement\nwith Turkey, signed in Ankara on September I 2 ,  1963, were important\nlandmarks. On the other hand, the breakdown in the negotiations on\nBritish membership, together with the consequent suspension of the\nparallel membership talks that had been going on with Denmark,\nNorway and Ireland, naturally attracted world-wide attention and\nmuch pessimistic comment. In the course of the controversy over the\nfailure of the British negotiations the postponement of the proposed\ntalks on the possible association with the Community of the \"three\nneutrals\" (Austria, Switzerland and Sweden) seems to have been\naccepted as logically inevitable. It is my purpose in this paper to draw\nattention to certain aspects of the status of these three States in inter-\nnational law and to examine any consequent limitations upon their\nmembership of, or association with, the Community.\n\nAlthough this area of international law is, in many respects, far from\nsettled and is the subject of much re-appraisal at the present time,\nit is possible to make certain assertions of law in general terms.\n(a) A \"neutralised\" State is one that has its independence and\nterritorial integrity guaranteed permanently by a collective agreement\nentered into by a group of large Powers. \"Permanent neutrality\" is\nnevertheless armed neutrality for the neutralised State is usually,\nin return, expected to refrain from hostilities of any kind, except in\nself-defence, but must defend itself from attack, with or without the\nassistance of the \"guarantor\" States, to the best of its ability. The\nC L  guarantor'' States undertake to refrain from attacking, or threaten-\ning to attack, the neutralised territory and they also usually promise\nto intervene by force, if called upon, should the neutralised State be\nattacked or threatened by other States. The neutralised State must\nnot enter into treaties of alliance, assistance, protection or guarantee\nwith other States-it\nmust, in general, remain outside political treaties\nor commitments which would involve the risk of hostilities or the loss\n\nof its special status. It must not allow any foreign intervention or inter-\nference in its internal affairs and it must strictly adhere to the rights\nand obligations of a neutral State in the event of war. It is, however,\nnot bound to observe an \"ideological neutrality\". \"Permanent neu-\ntrality\" or neutralisation imposes some fundamental restrictions on\nsovereignty but the permanent neutral is still a sovereign State and\nits special status is one acquired voluntarily and as a result of a treaty\nre1ationship.l Traditionally, neutralisation has been regarded as\nfundamentally different in its juridical nature from neutrality which\nis usually a status assumed by a State voluntarily for a limited time\nor purpose. It is interesting to recall that as recently as 1962 the State\nof Laos became neutralised by virtue of its own decision, embodied\nin a unilateral statement issued by the Laotian Government on July 9,\n1962, which in turn was \"guaranteed\" by the terms of the Thirteen-\nPower Declaration issued at Geneva on July 23, 1962.\n\n(b) \"Neutrality\" conveys to the in",

These provisions are generally drawn in the form of\nrestrictions or limitations, i.e., for use only in the production of product\nA, for use for X years only, for use only in country C, etc. In addition,\nknow-how licenses always contain a provision which requires that the\nknow-how be kept secret by the licensee or disclosed by him only\nunder conditions designed to protect the secrecy of the information.\n\nIn its communication of December 24, 1962, the Commission of\nthe European Economic Community has ruled that limitations such as\nthose described above, so long as they are within the scope of the\npatent grant, do not fall within the prohibition of Article 85(1).\n\nThe Commission quite properly considers such provisions as a delinea-\ntion of the grant and not as limitations which prevent, restrict or\ndistort competition.\n\nIn the field of industrial know-how, the Commission has taken the\nposition that it will not issue a general ruling but will consider each\ncase on its own merits.

ROBERT\nKRUITHOF\nAssistant at the Law Faculu, UniuersiQ of Ghent\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\nThe Common Market regulation of competition between private\nfirms is an expression of continental European economic and political\nphilosophies and interests. Due to the differences with other philoso-\nphies and interests, transactions affecting trade in the Common Market\nand in one or more foreign markets may, therefore, be subject to\nconflicting regulatory policies. The application of the E.E.C. anti-trust\nprovisions creates such conflicts, for the economic policies sf foreign\ncountries allow or even encourage restraints of competition prohibited\nby the Common Market anti-trust laws, and vice versa.\n\nMost countries, for example, permit export cartels. However, what\nconstitutes exports for one country means imports for another. Since\nmost countries apply their anti-trust laws to imports, it is obvious that\nthis situation leads to conflicts of law. Another example : in the United\nStates certain cartels are illegal per se, i.e., they are conclusively\npresumed to be illegal by reason of their nature or their necessary\neffects. In most European countries, on the other hand, these same\nrestrictive trade practices are usually legal when they contribute to\nthe improvement of production or distribution and when they are\nnot detrimental to the interests of the consumers. Consequently, an\nagreement between an American and a French company to divide\nthe European market and to fix prices in that part of the world would\nprobably be declared illegal by the American courts as an unreaso-\nnable restraint on the American foreign commerce, but might be\njustifiable under Article 85, para. 3 of the Rome Treaty.\n\nBefore the problem of the applicability of the Common Market\nanti-trust provisions to inter~lational restraints of trade can be dis-\ncussed, it is necessary to define the term international restraint of\ntrade. A cartel is an international cartel when it has as its object or\neffect the regulation of a market which is a foreign market for one or\nmore members of the combination. Pursuant to this definition inter-\nnational cartels include: (i) cartels whose members are nationals\nof different States; (ii) cartels which have international objectives\nor effects, i.e., cartels either of nationals, or of foreigners, or of both,\nwhich affect different national markets; and (iii) cartels whose econom-\n69\n\nic objectives or egects are purely national, but whose members are\nforeigners, and the converse situation: cartels whose members are\nnationals, but whose objectives or effects are entirely foreignO1\nHowever, the term international restraint of trade is broader than\nthe notion international cartel. Indeed, it includes also the restrictive\ntrade practices caused by a single firm. Individual restraints of trade,\nsuch as individual refusals to deal, discrimination by a firm between\nits customers and the action by an enterprise to monopolize a market\nor to take improper advantage of its dominant position in that market,\nare international restraints of trade when they have as their object or\neffect the regulation of a market which is a foreign market for the\nfim causing the restraint of trade.\n\nSuch individual international restrictive practices include: (i) in-\ndividual restraints of trade which have international objectives or\neffects, ie., individual restraints of trade by a national or foreigner\nwhich affect differ",

Private parties derive rights from Article 12 of the Treaty, which,\nin terms of the Van Gend @ Loos judgment (case No. 26/62), they can apply to their\nnational courts to have protected. When one of these rights can be legally disturbed\nthrough the operation of escape clauses in the Treaty,  hen legal certainty militates\nin favour of the private parties affected knowing how far their Community rights\nhave been diminished. It would be a noteworthy retrograde step on the road towards\nrecognising legal certainty as a legal norm, \"which must be taken into consideration\nin implementing the Treaty\" _ CBosch judgment, case No. I 3/61, April 6, 1962,\nRecueil VIII, p. 107), if the mere existence of a widely-drafted escape clause such\nas Article 226 were to absolve the institutions of the Community from their duty to\nmake any diminution of a right guaranteed by an express provision of zhe Treaty\nknown to those affected. There are clearly distinguishable categories of decisions\nto which this requirement, which is necessary for legal certainty, although going\nbeyond the provisions of Article 191, is applicable. These are decisions taken by che\nHigh Authority in pursuance of the last paragraph of Article 65(2) of the E.C.S.C.\n\nTreaty. \"Decisions granting, renewing, modifying, refusing or revoking an authori-\nsation shall be published together with the reasons therefor. . . \". The same holds\ngood for decisions taken by the E.E.C. Commission on the grounds of Articles 2,3,6,\n7 and 8 of the first anti-cartel regulation, No. 17. Article 21 of the regulation so\nprovides. Consequently, formal requirements going beyond the requirements of\nArticle I Q I  can be laid down for decisions. Must these, however, be based exclusively\nupon written Community law? In my view, decisions, by which member States have\na power to issue orders, which was taken away from them by the operation of Com-\nmunity law, restored to them, shouldalso be required to be published, in terms of\nunwritten Community law. They form, after all, an adjunct to the law of the\nTreaties and they can serve as the basis for national legal provisions. Where neces-\nsary, these provisions must be tested against them. It is to be hoped that the Court\nwill shortly have an opportunity to give this rule of unwritten Community law a\nfirmer foundation than was done in the judgment printed above.\n\nSk.\n\nB.

Moreover, the plaintiff is mistaken in basing\nhis claim on Art. 40.(3) of the E.E.C. Treaty. This provision contains an outline of\nthe agricultural policy of the Community, but does nor stipulate concrete rules guid-\ning the administration.\n\n(3) The Regulations of the Council are binding in every respect and directly\napplicable in the Federal Republic (Art. 189 of the E.E.C.

The Consti-\ntution provides for such a procedure: \"the Federation (Bund) may, by legislation,\ntransfer sovereign powers to inter-governmental institutions\" (Art. 24.). This\nmeans that the amending of the Constitution has been anticipated by the Consti-\ntution itself leaving the implementation to the legislators.\n\n(b) The issue of Regulations by the Council does not violate the Constitution.\n\nIt may remain unanswered in this context whether the Council must be character-\nized as an executive or as a legislative body.

Sovereign power may ody be\ntransferred to institutions which acknowledge the same basic principles as does the\nFederal Republic in her Constitution. Precisely construed, the institution under\nconsideration must adhere to the rule of law, must recognise the basic and human\nrights and must be prepared to protect selfgovernment, family and property.

The matter regularly makes large or small headlines\nin the newspapers, but the longau~aited and so necessary marriage\nbetween national energy policies has still not taken place. Despite\nall attempts in that direction, a European energy policy is hardly\ntaking shape, if at all. On the contrary, the diversity of opinion re-\ngarding such a policy form part of the dark clouds which lend so\nsombre an aspect to European horizons.*\nIn these circumstances, a study of the legal aspects of a European\nenergy policy is of necessity of a hypothetical nature. It is a question\nde lege ferenda and as such is governed by a number of choices of a high-\nly political nature which have still to be made. The legal implica-\ntions differ according to whether Community policy is to remain\nlimited to a certain amount of co-ordination of existing national\nregulations or is to be expanded to create a real common market.\n\nIn the former case-probably\nthe line of least resistance-existing\nnational powers and regulations made thereunder will to a large\nextent remain in force. Community activity would be directed in\nparticular towards doing away with the most flagrant of the then exis-\nting distortions, both between the various sources of energy and be-\ntween the various national regulations applying to such sources.\n\nThe more ambitious aim would consist of the bringing into being\nof a genuine common energy market, in which coal, oil, natural gas\nand atomic energy would compete freely against one another, with\ntheir different economic backgrounds, but otherwise under compara-\nble governmental, fiscal, social and legal circumstances. Responsi-\nbility for such a market would then lie with the organs of the Com-\nmunity and not with the national governments. This is also true so\nfar as concerns commercial policy, i.e. the tariff protection at itsex-\nternal frontier which the common energy market will have to enjoy.\n\nThe existing system of national regulations will in principle be trans-\n* Since this article was written the six governments concluded a Protocol of\nAgreement concrrning a common energy market (Oficial Gazette 1099/64). The\narea of consensus on problems of substance concerning such a market remains never-\ntheless very small indeed. A discussion of this Protocol in the context of Mr. Van\nder Esch's contribution did not therefcre appear necessary. (Ed.)\n\nformed into a Community policy. Without involving ourseIves in the\npolitical merits of the two solutions-which\nare, moreover, to a cer-\ntain extent close to one another -we\nshall take as our point of de-\nparture in this article that a common energy policy would aim at\nestablishing a real common market. Only on this assumption can an\ninsight be gained into the full extent of the legal implications.\n\nWe must, however, work on the basis of a second hypothesis too.\n\nThe content of the rules which will govern a true common market for\nenergy depends to a very great extent upon whether protectionist\ntendencies gain the upper hand or whether the market is going to be\none which is open to cheaper energy imported from third countries.\n\nHere again, the choice between these alternatives is not a legal pro-\nblem. A sol~tion may perhaps be found by taking as a point of depar-\nture the \"Memorandum on Energy Policy\" of June 2 j, 1962, which\nwas drawn up by the three European Executives-the\nHigh Author-\nity of the E.C.S.C.",

Certainly not all\ncomment rests upon the premise that a European Parliament has an\nessential role to play at this stage of Community development, prior\nto a real agreement on political and military union. Yet, while @om-\nmunity decisionmaking has not been unresponsive to the demands\nand needs of the divergent interests thereby affected, the appeals for\ngreater democratization of the Communities seem well justified : In\nthe first place, the more as Community policies are financed out of\nCommunity resources over which the national parliaments have no\nsay, the greater the gap in popular control-unless\ncompensatory\npowers are bestowed on the European Parliament. Secondly, the\nfusion of the Communities will mean the greater consolidation of\npowers in the \"executive branch \"and on the \"ministerial level\" over\nagainst which the Parliament must come to serve as an effective coun-\nter balance, focussing increased publicity on the decisional process\nand giving freer scope to the principle of parliamentary responsibility.\n\nFinally, a strengthened Parliament with a vigorous tradition of cross-na-\ntional debate and voting may itself assist the transition to close inte-\ngration, providing a plausible \"supranational9' legislature as alterna-\ntive to the present process of ministerial negotiation. We pass over,\nfor the purposes of the present discussion, the question whether the\nEuropean Parliament in its present form is capable of realizing all\nthese objectives; likewise, the question of what changes in form and\ncomposition such as partial or complete direct elections, would be\nuseful in this direction and compatible with the Rome and E.C.S.C.\n\nTreaties in their present text.l Nor do we treat the broad problem of\nincreasing parliamentary powers in the legislative process generally.\n\nNever absent indeed from the thoughts of many European and\nnational parliamentarians, and considered at least peripherally in a\nI .

It is of course not the Court's intention to regard the decision on\nthe question whether a product may be a subject of competition between member\nStates as wholly apart from the interpretation of Article 37. In case of doubt Article\nI 7 j will have to afford a solution. A decision in each individual case by the domes-\ntic courts will not, therefore, on the basis of Article 177 bar a Court ruling on pos-\nsible requests for interpretation. Nor may the first-mentioned consideration be inter-\npreted as meaning that the actual absence of competition between member States\n\n-which\ncan only be a result of the monopoly-and\nthe consequent failure of the\norgan in question to play a role of importance in the trade between the member\nStates, would in themselves suffice to bar operation of Article 3 j in respect of the\nmonopoly. To remove this doubt, it would be important for the Court to be given\nan opportunity to make another ruling on Art. 37 in respect of a concrete case.\n\nSuch an opportunity does already exist since the request of the Civil Court of Rome\nfor a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of Article 3 j (decision of January\n18, 1964, Albatros v.

Doubts have been expressed about this by Ronzitti (\"Article 1 2  of the Treaty\nestablishing the European Economic Community and the relationship between the\n\nlegal o~der of ihe Comiriiiity and the municipal legal arders cf the member States\",\nPart IV of Foro Italiano I 964) ; but these doubts have no raison d'2tre except in relation\nto an examination of the matter from a purely international point of view. We\nshould note once again, in this connection, that the Treaties establishing the Euro-\npean Communities cannot be interpreted in accordance with the classic canons of\ninternational law. The legal order of the Community is not an independent one,\nof an almost \"astral\" nature, separate from the municipal legal systems of the\nmember States. On the contrary, it has grafted itself thoroughly onto the municipal\nlegal systems of those States, which it has supplemented and modified in certain\nvery important fie!ds. In order to explain this phenomenon it is not sufficient to\ndescribe the provisions of the Treaties establishing the European Communities as\nof \"immediate\" application, for this does not suffice to explain the scope and the\ndirect and indirect legal force of Community \"regulations\" and \"directives\".\n\nIf it be recognised that member States intended to agree to a \"self-limitation\" of\ntheir own powers, in order to enable the Community to carry out those tash assign-\ned to it by the Treaty establishing it, it must be admitted that this involves a re-\nnunciation (in accordance with Article I I of the Italian constitution) of some of\ntheir sovereign powers-which\nis a consequence of such \"self-limitation\".\n\nThe Court of Justice has correctly recognised this. And it cannot be argued that\nthe municipal legal orders of the member States have remained as they were before,\nso that such States might reassert their competence and infringe the Treaty or amend\nit; in fact, the amendment of the Treaty constitutes a normal development of the\nlegal order of the Community: one in accordance, moreover, with the provisions\nof the Treaties themselves, and the actual fact of the usurpation of a power previous-\nly transferred to the Community must not be confused with the lawfulness of such\na usurpation.\n\nConsequently, it seems to me that the Court of Justice was quite right when it\nheld that the provisions of the Treaty of a purely prohibitive nature involve the\nincompetence of member States to legislate on the matters concerned. All this is\nof indubitable importance in connection with the protection of the rights of citizens,\nwho may accordingly rely on such incompetence in order to obtain conservential\nmeasures of relief within the framework of their own national legal system.\nI would consequently humbly submit that, on the basis of the finding of the Euro-\npean Court referred to above, it must be held, under the Italian legal system, that\nthere has been a violation of Article I I of the Constitution. In other legal systems\nthe consequences may be different in form, while leading to analogous practical\nresults. In the case which it decided, the Court of Justice furnished the Courts of\nthe Netherlands with material allowing them to decline. in accordance with a prin-\nciple of the Constitution of that country, to apply a law in confllct with Article 1 2  of\nthe E.E.C.

This trend is particularly\nstrong with regard to corporations and other companies having\nshare capital. Therefore, an assimilation of laws in this sector is\nurgently needed.\n\nT H E  P R E S E N T  D I F F I C U L T I E S\nThe basic legal provision is Article 58 ( I )  of the E.E.C. Treaty.\n\nIt provides that companies which have been constituted in accordance\nwith the law of a member State and having their registered office,\ncentral management or main establishment within the Community\nshall be assimilated to natural persons being nationals of member\nStates. Therefore, the freedom of establishment laid down in the\nE,E.C. Treaty is also applicable to them. From this it follows that the\nduty to grant the right of establishment carries with it the obligation\nto recognise the companies defined in Article 58 (2) both as a legal\nentity and as being able to act under the law of the land. As it stands\nalready today, the general recognition of business companies inside\nthe Community presents no major difficultie~.~\nThis liberal structure\nI .

The result are undesirable difficulties and\nuncertainties: scarcely anyone is con~pletely aware of the intricacies\nof company laws in another member State, the public is accustomed\nto the legal necessities of one national law and most parties will be\nof opinion that the foreign law to be applied depends very much on\nthe same principles as the law at home and does not allow for any\nlarge di~ergency.~\nThe problem which has thus arisen has achieved\neven greater importance by the fact that business across the borders\nof member States is today often conducted by small or medium-\nsized companie",

LEON J. DE KEYSER\nBaker, McKenzie & Hightower, Brussels\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\nThe genius of American business lies in its distribution system. Its\nways and methods of bringing new or known products into the hands\nof the ultimate consumer are unique and prodigious.\n\nUnfortunately, the United States antitrust laws, in their enforce-\nment and interpretation, have not kept pace with the miraculous\ndevelopment of the distribution sector. This makes it necessary to\nexamine in detail the legal structure of the distribution system in\nwhich, except for price fixing, many problems remain unsolved. The\nfield of vertical exclusive arrangements in particular, presents us\nwith a set of questions which have remained unanswered. The fact\nthat, prior to White Motor Co. v. United States,l no Supreme Court\ndecision has ever closely examined territorial and customer restric-\ntions is significant in this respect. Still more significant is Justice\nDouglas' confession that the Court needed \". .. to know more than\nit did about the actual impact of these arrangements on competition.. .\"\nto decide the case pr~perly.~\nThe creation of the European Common Market, with its new and,\nso far, vague and unprecise antitrust rules, has created identical\nproblems for manufacturers desiring to distribute their products\nwithin the Common Market. The fact that exclusive distributorship\narrangements are part of day-to-day business life makes it all the\nmore urgent to come up, on both sides of the Atlantic, with a clear\nand coherent set of rules governing such arrangements.\n\nThe endeavor of this article is to analyse one particularly important\naspect of exclusive arrangements : the territorial restriction3 or export\nI .  372 U.S. 253 (1963)\n\n2. Id. at 263.\n3. A territorial restriction, as used in this study is a promise by several dealers or\ndistributors of the same supplier or manufacturer not to sell outside the assigned\nterritory. The term \"export prohibition\" implies the same restriction but it connotates\na transaction involving different countries. It seems therefore that such term is more\nappropriate with respect to the Common Market where the assigned territory of\ndealers frequently coincides with a particular country. Other aspects of vertical\nexclusive arrangements are the exclusive franchise, the customer restriction and the\nexclusive dealing practice. An exclusive franchise is a promise by the manufacturer or\n\nprohibition, and to evaluate its legality under the antitrust laws\nof the United States and in the Common Market.\n\nThe recent decision of the Commission in the Cowten case makes\nthis subject particularly up-to-date and it provides some first hand\nmaterial for comparing the two systems.\n\nThis study of territorial restrictions is divided into three parts.\n\nPart I is an analysis of the United States case law and a legal evalua-\ntion thereof. Part 11 gives an outline of the Common iVIarket antitrust\nlaw with a particular reference to the recent Grundig-Consten decision\nand Part 111 is a comparison of the two legal systems.\n\nP A R T  I.

Having regard to the lack of precision of most of\nthe social provisions of the Treaty of Rome there have so far been few\nspectacular decisions in this field, but there is some call to consider\nthis subject in detail.\n\nWith regard to the movement of persons a distinction must first of\nall be drawn between the circulation of tourists-which,\nalthough\nfrom the numerical point of view it is today the greatest of all, is of no\nrelevance to the subject with which we are concerned-and\nthe move-\nment with the aim of settling in another country. The concept of\nsettlement is not homogeneous either. It can be temporary or perma-\nnent ; it can be with an eye to studying or to gaining of practical experi-\nence in a trade or profession; it can be with an eye to spending an\nincome or with an eye to earning one. And finally, this last group too\nmust further be divided into employed persons and the self-employed.\n\nThe new Regulation, which deals with temporary as well as (more)\npermanent establishment, lays down rules only for making the move-\nment of employed persons within the Community freer, though not yet\nfree. Is this matter so important that a complicated supranational law\nneeds to be devoted to it, with numerous binding provisions as to\nits implementation and for the setting up of special bodies at the natio-\nnal and Community level? In order to answer this question, it is\nperhaps appropriate to glance at the history of the international move-\nment of persons since the beginning of this century.\n\n* The author is an official of the State Labour Office in the Ministry of Social\nAffairs and Public Health of the Netherlands.

W.O., Law Faculty of Louuain\nMore than four years have passed since the enactment of the Belgian\nLaw of May 27, 1960 for protection against the abuse of economic\np0wer.l The present essay will concern itself with the very first period\nof antitrust enforcement, from its enactment until June 1964.\n\nOur study is divided into four parts. Part I contains an overall picture\nof the Belgian antitrust law \"in action\". Part 11 is concerned with the\nspecial provision of Article 27 of the 1960 Act for the exemption of\npublic enterprises. The function of part 111 is to consider the relation\nbetween the Law of May 27, 1960 and other national statutes dealing\nwith restrictive business practices and market power. Last, part IV\ncovers the relation between the Belgian Law and international legis-\nlation, viz. the \"Rules of Competition for Enterprises\" of the E.Z.C.\n\nTreaty and the pertinent provisions of the Benelux Treaty.\n\nThese four parts are preceded by a short summary of the major\nprovisions of the present statutory antitrust law.2\nWe do not intend to discuss in detail the question as to whether\nor not the actual Belgian legislation is a sufficient instrument for the\nprotection of competition. We simply want to present a fair view of\nthe enforcement of the Law of May 27, 1960 in its current state and\nof the problems raised by it.\n\nThe substantive law relating to abuses of economic power is found\nin the first two articles of the Law of May 27, 1960, containing the\npivotal concepts of the regulation: \"economic power\" and \"abuse\".\n\nEconomic power is defined as \"power possessed by a natural or\njuristic person, acting individually, or a group of such persons, acting\nin concert, to exert, within the territory of the Kingdom by means of\nindustrial, commercial, agricultural or financial activities, a pre-\nponderant influence upon the supply of the market with goods or\ncapital or upon the price or quality of particular goods and ser~ices\"~.\n\nRemarkably enough, horizontal and vertical agreements of all types\n\nI.

The effect and scope of the ~ e I ~ i a n\nregulation con-\nsists merely in creating means to put an end to abuses of a dominant\nposition. Such an abuse is committed \"whenever one or more persons\npossessing economic power inflict harm upon the public interest by\nmeans of practices which adulterate or restrict the normal play of com-\npetition or which hamper either the economic freedom of producers,\ndistributors or consumers or the development of production or com-\nmerce\" (Article 2 ) .\n\n4. Professor Dr. 6. van Hecke rightly criticizes this feature as follows: \"Enterprises\nwith a dominant market position, if able to fix prices and define production on their\nown initiative, benefit from the cost price advantages resulting from their production\nvolume.

They are constituted not by the aggregate\nof the measures actually applied at that date, but by such measures as can be ap-\nplied immediately and actually as part of the organisation. An increase in internal\ncost factors resulting in an increase in the national price guarantees above the level\nof January I, 1958, must also lead to an increase of the variable import duty. If\nthis is impossible, or cannot be carried out without co-operation of the Community,\none cannot speak of maintenance of the existing national system. If, on the other\nhand, the judgment envisages solely the introduction of new charges, Article 12 is\ngiven a reasonable application with regard to agricultural products, mentioned in\nthe list of Annex 11 to the Treaty. The impossibility to charge imports as a comple-\nment of internal measures either disqualifies the system existing on January I, 1958\nas a national market organisation, or it does not. In the former case a national\nmarket organisation does not exist and the Treaty nowhere offers the States a basis for\nestablishing a national market organisation for agricultural products listed in An-\nnex I1 following the entry into force of the Treaty. In the latter case the national\nmarket organisation was complete on January I, 1958. But its extension to new\ncomponents has no basis in the Treaty either. Within the limits thus drawn, the\njudgment would also make the greatest contribution to the actual substitution of\nnational market organisations by Community organisation where necessary. The\nview defended by Belgium and Luxembourg, with its exceptional liberty for the\nnational authorities to extend and intensify existing systems, would hardly encour-\nSk.\n\nage such substitution.\n\nB.

The defendant was deported to Italy in May 1954, but in spite of the resi-\ndence prohibition re-entered the Federal Republic in September 1963. At the time\nof re-entry he presented to the immigration authorities a document from the Ger-\nman Consul General in Milan stating that Italian workers need no visa for entry\nin order to take up employment. While attempting to register with the local au-\nthorities, he was arrested. The police commissioner asked the local court to issuea\ndecree that the defendant be kept in custody for three weeks in order to secure his\ndeportation. The local Court (Amtsgericht) refused the request on the grounds that\nit would be a breach of good faith in international relations and the objectives of\nthe Treaty of Rome to base a decree on the residence prohibition issued in \"54\nThe District Court, however, took the opposite view.\n\nI.

All grounds mentioned\nin section 5(1) (a)-(i) of the Auslander~olizeiilerordnung (APVO) fall under this broad\nconcept. According to Section j(1) (b) APVO, a residence prohibition may be\nissued against a foreign subject on conviction for a single crime or offence commit-\nted within the territory of the Federal Republic. This was the case here: the de-\nfendant was convicted five times by various German courts.\n\nNote: This decision was rendered before the issue of Council directive 64/22 I/EEC,\nO.G. 850164 for the coordination of special measures governing the entry and\nresidence of foreign nationals in cases where such measures are warranted on grounds\nof pubiic policy, pubiic safety, or public health (cJ 2 C.l\\/r.L. Rev. 1964-5, pp. 105-106).\n\nArticle 3, par. 2 of this directive states that criminal convictions shall not in them-\nselves be considered grounds of public policy etc. Additional facts relating to the\npersonal conduct of the person involved must therefore be present in order to jus-\ntify a deportation measure. Although it is difficult to say whether the instant case\nwould have been decided differently, it seems clear that the provision of Section\nj ( 1 )  (b) of the APVO will have to be modified in order to comply with the E.E.C.\ndirective.\n\nThis is not the first time that a German court had to decide on the question whether\nan Italian national should be refused a residence permit. On October 26, 1962 the\nAdministrative Court (Verwaltungsgericht) of Berlin ruled that a worker from another\nmember State of the E.E.C. must be issued a residence permit where he has\nalready been granted a work permit and no objections exist on grounds of public\norder, public security or public health. In this case the court stated that the con-\ncept of public order and security was not to be construed narrowly, as it is in Ger-\nman police law, but should rather be given its broader meaning as generally under-\nL.J.B.\nstood in other continental countries.\n23.

The plaintiffs had registered the mark as an international trade mark,\nbut registration in the Netherlands had been refused to the plaintiffs as the mark\nwas confiscated as enemy property during the last war and was now in totally dif-\nferent hands. Tliere was no connection between the plaintiffs and the holders of\nthe mark in the Netherlands and the plaintiffs had in no way consented to the Dutch\nholders putting goods marked 'Persil' into circulation. The plaintiEs were therefore\nentitled to an injunction. Nor could the defendant rely on Articles 85 or 86 of the\nRome Treaty as there was no agreement between the two proprietors.

These negotiations,\nwhich have become generally known as the \"Kennedy Round,\" are\nthe sixth in a series initiated in 194.7 pursuant to the General Agree-\nment on Tariffs and Trade.l Their primary objective is to reduce,\ninsofar as may be possible, the obstacles to commercial intercourse\nwhich still persist among the major trading nations. Beyond this\nimmediate purpose lie broader and equally fundamental objectives\nof promoting political as well as economic cooperation among the\nparticipants, and of achieving more balanced and viable trading\nrelationships between the industrialized nations and the developing\nregions of the world.\n\nThe negotiations presently in progress in Geneva will, like their\npredecessors, concentrate largely on the mutual reduction of tariff\nlevels maintained by the industrialized countries. Yet as tariffs are\nprogressively reduced, other forms of import restrictions will in-\nevitably assume a greater significance. The restrictive implications of\nthese non-tariff barriers have become increasingly recognized in\nrecent years2\n\nI.

The Ministerial\nConference of the General Agreement adopted a resolution on May\n2 1, 1963, which specified the principles and procedures that are to\nguide the negotiations. The resolution expressly provided that they\n\"shall deal not only with tariffs but also with non-tariff  barrier^.\"^\n\nI.

Non-tariff restrictions are, of course, one of the techniques traditionally employed\nto limit imports. They have therefore been familiar to international traders for\nmany years. Their importance has, however, become proportionately greater to-\nday as a result of the general lowering of tariffs which has occurred anlong the major\ntrading nations.\n3. Statement of principles, paragraph 3.\n\nThe Conference also created a Trade Negotiations Committee to\nformulate and implement detailed procedures pursuant to this\nresolution, and expressly directed the Committee to establish the\n\"rules to govern and the methods to be employed in the treatment of\nnon-tariff barriers.\"\nThe organizational structure which has been developed for the\nconduct of the Kennedy Round reflects this concern with non-tariff\nbarriers. The Trade Negotiations Committee has four principal sub-\ncommittees, which deal respectively with the tariff negotiating plan,\nthe developing nations, agricultural problems and non-tariff barriers.\n\nThe last of these subcommittees has, in turn, established seven working\ngroups, each of which has cognizance of a major category of non-\ntariff restrictions. These are the working groups on valuation, internal\ntaxation, government procurement, administrative and technical\nregulations, quantitative restrictions, state trading and dumping.\n\nIt should be observed that whereas the Trade Negotiations Com-\nmittee includes all of the participants in the Kennedy Round, the\nmembership of the Subcommittee on Non-Tariff Barriers consists\npredominantly of the indust",

The word union is\nstretched in this context to denote a variety of forms of association,\nranging from a loose alliance where heads of state or of government\nmeet each other three times a year, to a highly-organised political\ncommunity or a federation. But if \"union\" is ambiguous, \"poolitical'\"\nis misleading; for it is used here in contradistinction to   economic'^, to\nindicate a union that is concerned with questions of foreign policy\nand defence, as if economic questions were in some sense outside\npolitics.\n\nYet, if a question can be classed as \"political\" to the extent that it\noccupies the time of parliament or of government, or becomes an issue\nthat wins or loses votes during an election, then economic questions are\npar excellence the political ones of this century. What could be more\npolitical than the power to control agricultural prices and subsidies?\n\nTo keep open coal mines or to shut them down? To prosecute mono-\npolies and cartels or to leave them be? To decide on social policies such\nas equal pay for women? These are matters within the competence of\nthe European Economic Community and the European Coal and\nSteel Community. It seems strange to attach the word \"political\" to\ndefence arrangements but not to issues such as these.\n\nIt seems equally strange to speak of a political union that will deal\nwith foreign policy while the Economic Community deals with\neconomic policy. The institutions of the Economic Community are\nalready responsible for the major part of the external economic\nrelations of the Community, and in particular for negotiations relating\nto tariffs and other barriers to trade. And just as economics is the\nsubject matter of a large proportion of contemporary politics, so are\nexternal economic relations a substantial part of the subject matter of\nforeign policy. Indeed, it would be more reasonable, since economics\nand defence are the two great pillars of foreign policy, to speak of an\neconomic union (or community) and a defence union (or community)\nas the two bases of political, or foreign policy, union.\n\nThus it is more enlightening to consider the Economic Community\nas one half of a political union, which may eventually be completed by\nthe addition of a defence union. To do otherwise, and to call the union\nbased on defence the political union, is to imply that politics are con-\ncerned basically with frontiers, armies and alliances. This was true\n420\n\nonce, before the industrial revolution and universal suffrage brought\neconomics to the forefront of the poiiticai process. It is no longer true,\nand terms that imply that it is are bound to lead to confusion. Un-\nfortunately, however, the term political union is used almost always\nto denote a union with competence in fields not covered by the\nEconomic Community and, while duly remarking upon this misuse\nof words, in the hope of forestalling the misunderstandings that might\nresult, there seems to be no alternative but to accept the common\nusage. Political union is, then, for the purpose of this article, a union\nconcerned with defence and with those aspects of foreign policy not\nfalling within the competence of the European Economic Community.\n\nThe ambiguity of the word union is not so easily dealt with, because\nit conceals a deep divergence of view about the proper way to organise\nEurope, which has been one of the main reasons why the Six have\nfailed to agree on a political union in the last five years.

W.O., Law Faculty of Louvain\n\"Conflicts between a directly applicable international source of law\nand a Belgian domestic law, which cannot be solved by reconciliatory\ninterpretation, have thus far been decided, under Belgian constituti-\nonal law, in favour of the most recent source of law. Regrettable though\nthis may be, especially if as a result a domestic source of law prevails\nover a Community source, it is none the less a fact in positive law\".\n\nIn this way Professor F. Rigaux-in\na note on the \"Van Gend &\nLoos\" judgment (Journal des Tribunaux, 1963, p. 191, no. 12)-quite\ncorrectly stated in 1963 the virtually unanimous view of Belgian legal\ndoctrine and administration of justice on the relationship between\nCommunity and domestic law: lex posterior derogat priori. But a major\nchange has meanwhile set in, so that it would seem profitable to analy-\nse the current position of Belgian doctrine and to determine clearly\nthe principles governing the matter.\n\nIt should be pointed out to begin with that the problem of the re-\nlationship between an international agreement and domestic law is\ndifferent according to whether the treaty provisions are self-exe-\ncuting or not.\n\nIf an international agreement entails only obligations for the State,\nconflicts with domestic legislation cannot arise, because persons\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the law courts of that State cannot\nacquire subjective rights on the ground of such a treaty alone. Never-\ntheless, in such cases there may still be the problem of the State's\nliability for failure to observe the obligations imposed by the treaty.\n\nIn traditional international law it is a principle that the inter-\nnational liability of a State concerns the activities of the Legislative,\nthe Executive and the Judiciary (Cf. E. Suy, De Internationale en\nEuropese aansprakelijkheid der E.E.G.-Lidstaten, Revue belge de droit\ninternational, 1965, p. 142, no. 3). On the international plane, however,\na wrongful act occurs only if a third party (another State, a national\nof another State or, in exceptional cases, a national of the State in\nquestion) is prejudiced by infringement of an obligation under an\ninternational agreement (P. Guggenheim, Traite' de droit international\n\npublic, I%, Geneva, 1954, p. 1; F. Van Goethem & E. Suy, Beknoft\nHandboek van het Volkenrecht, htwerp/Amsterdam, s.d. (1963)~ p. 19).\n\nAs a rule Liability on the part of a State arises only when the Judici-\nary or the Executive gives effect to a law which is contrary to obiiga-\ntions undertaken by virtue of an international agreement. (See, how-\never, Ingo von Miinch, Das Viilkerrechdiche Delikt in der modernen\nEntwicklung der V6lkerre~htsgemeinschaft~ FrankfurtlMain, 1963,\np. 190-192).\n\nHow do the Belgian courts act in such a case?\n\nTo start with, a court will try to evade the problem by the technique\nof \"interpretation in conformity with the treaty\", i.e., by inter-\npreting the provisions of the domestic law in such a way that they\nconform with the treaty obligations (Cf. Court of Cassation, Jan-\nuary 8, 1925, Pasicrisie, 1925, I, IOI ; Court of Cassation, March 23,\n1920, Pasicrisie, 1920, I, 104). But this is not always possible. In a\njudgment of November 26, 1925 the Court of Cassation ruled in this\nrespect that: \"it is incumbent on the Belgian legislator, when issuing\ndecisions in fulfilment of an international agreement, to judge whether\nthe rules thus laid down are in conf",

It\nis moreover always permissible for the parties concerned who consider themselves\n\ninjured by the unlawful decisions of a member State to invoke the competent\ncoilrrbj of that State t~ investigate and annul the said decisisns, in srder te ebtain an\nappropriate safeguard for their rights and interests, under the conditions that the\ncourts are empowered, either voluntarily or not as the case may be, to invoke the\nprocedure of Article 177 in order to establish the interpretation, which is uniform\nfor the whole Community, of the complex provisions of the said Chapter 2 and the\nrelationships between them.\n\nThe above considerations apply generally to the questions asked by the Court of\nRome without it being necessary to refer to them separately.\n\nThere is no need to decide, in the present case, the question whether or not the\napplication of Article 37 to the national monopolies excludes the application of\nevely other provision of the chapter relative to the removal of quantitative restric-\ntions between the member States, the effect of one or other interpretation being\nidentical within the framework of the legal considerations provided by the Court\nof Rome.\n\nThere is also no occasion to examine in the present case which provisions referred\nto by the Court are directly applicable to the persons subject to the jurisdiction\nof the member States.\n\nAccordingly it is only necessary to reply to the questions asked that none of the\narticles of the Treaty named in them involves the abrogation from the date of the\nentry into force of the Treaty, of the quantitative restrictions, discriminations or\nmeasures of equivalent effect in existence at that date, nor which obliges the States\nto remove them completely as from 1959.\n\nThe costs of the parties are reserved to the Civil Court of Rome.\n\nComments on this important decision will follow in a forthcoming issue of the Common Market\nLaw Review.\n8.
